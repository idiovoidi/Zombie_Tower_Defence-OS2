# Persistent Effects Cleanup Verification

## Summary
Verification that all persistent effects are properly registered with ResourceCleanupManager and unregistered when they expire naturally or during wave transitions.

## Persistent Effect Locations

### ✅ All Persistent Effects Properly Managed

| Location | Effect Type | Registration | Natural Expiration | Wave Cleanup |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **VisualEffects.ts** | | | | |
| - createDamageIndicator() | damage_indicator | ✅ | ✅ (1000ms timeout) | ✅ |
| - createDamageFlash() | damage_flash | ✅ | ✅ (500ms animation) | ✅ |
| **Tower.ts** | | | | |
| - showDamageFlash() | tower_damage_flash | ✅ | ✅ (100ms timeout) | ✅ |
| **Projectile.ts** | | | | |
| - createExplosion() | explosion | ✅ | ✅ (400ms animation) | ✅ |
| - createFirePool() | fire_pool | ✅ | ✅ (2000ms fade) | ✅ |
| - createSludgePool() | sludge_pool | ✅ | ✅ (4000-7000ms fade) | ✅ |
| **TowerCombatManager.ts** | | | | |
| - createLightningArc() | tesla_lightning | ✅ | ✅ (150ms timeout) | ✅ |
| - createFlameStream() | flame_stream | ✅ | ✅ (120ms timeout) | ✅ |
| - createElectricParticles() | tesla_particles | ✅ | ✅ (180-250ms fade) | ✅ |

## Registration Pattern

All persistent effects follow the correct pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Create Graphics object
const graphics = new Graphics();
// ... draw graphics ...

// 2. Register IMMEDIATELY after creation
ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(graphics, {
  type: 'effect_type',
  duration: durationMs,
  onCleanup: () => { /* optional cleanup logic */ }
});

// 3. Add to scene
container.addChild(graphics);

// 4. Set up natural expiration with timer
const timeout = EffectCleanupManager.registerTimeout(
  setTimeout(() => {
    // 5. Clear timer
    EffectCleanupManager.clearTimeout(timeout);
    
    // 6. Unregister from cleanup manager
    ResourceCleanupManager.unregisterPersistentEffect(graphics);
    
    // 7. Remove from scene and destroy
    if (graphics.parent) {
      graphics.parent.removeChild(graphics);
    }
    graphics.destroy();
  }, durationMs)
);
```

## Wave Transition Cleanup

### Cleanup Trigger Points

1. **Between Waves** (`cleanupWaveObjects()` in GameManager.ts)
   - Called after wave completes
   - Removes: persistent effects, projectiles, visual effects, blood particles
   - Keeps: corpses (fade naturally), towers, zombies

2. **Game Reset** (`clearGameState()` in GameManager.ts)
   - Called when starting new game
   - Removes: everything including zombies, towers, combat state

### Cleanup Order (Critical for Memory Safety)

```typescript
public static cleanupWaveResources(managers: GameManagers): void {
  // 1. FIRST: Clear all timers (prevents callbacks on destroyed objects)
  EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();
  
  // 2. THEN: Destroy persistent effects (safe now that timers are cleared)
  this.cleanupPersistentEffects();
  
  // 3. Clear other managers
  managers.projectileManager?.clear();
  managers.effectManager?.clear();
  managers.zombieManager?.getBloodParticleSystem().clear();
  
  // 4. Execute custom cleanup callbacks
  this.executeCleanupCallbacks();
}
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Registration Verification
- All persistent effects call `registerPersistentEffect()` immediately after creation
- All effects include proper metadata (type, duration)
- Effects with special cleanup needs provide `onCleanup` callbacks

### ✅ Natural Expiration Verification
- All effects use `EffectCleanupManager.registerTimeout/registerInterval` for timers
- All timers properly call `unregisterPersistentEffect()` before destroying
- All effects check `if (!graphics.destroyed)` before cleanup operations
- All effects remove from parent before destroying

### ✅ Wave Cleanup Verification
- `cleanupWaveResources()` is called in `cleanupWaveObjects()` after each wave
- `cleanupWaveResources()` is called in `startNextWave()` as safety check
- Cleanup order is correct: timers first, then objects
- `cleanupPersistentEffects()` handles already-destroyed objects gracefully

### ✅ Special Cases Handled

1. **Sludge Pools with Zombie Slow**
   - `onCleanup` callback removes slow from all affected zombies
   - Prevents zombies from staying slowed after pool is destroyed

2. **Tesla Particles Attached to Zombies**
   - Particles are children of zombie Container
   - Automatically destroyed when zombie is destroyed
   - Cleanup manager handles already-destroyed check

3. **Explosion Debris**
   - Multiple Graphics objects in single explosion
   - All managed through single persistent effect registration
   - Destroyed together as a unit

## Memory Leak Prevention

### Safeguards in Place

1. **Automatic Cleanup on Wave End**
   - All persistent effects tracked in Set
   - Cleared even if natural expiration fails
   - Prevents accumulation across waves

2. **Timer Tracking**
   - All timers registered with EffectCleanupManager
   - Cleared before objects destroyed
   - Prevents callbacks on destroyed objects

3. **Destroyed Check**
   - `cleanupPersistentEffects()` checks `graphics.destroyed`
   - Skips already-destroyed objects
   - Prevents double-destroy errors

4. **Parent Check**
   - Always checks `if (graphics.parent)` before removeChild
   - Prevents errors from orphaned graphics
   - Safe even if parent was destroyed

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Play through 5+ waves and verify no persistent effects remain
2. Check console for cleanup logs showing effect counts
3. Monitor memory usage - should stabilize after wave 5
4. Verify no visual artifacts remain after wave cleanup

### Automated Testing
1. Create test that spawns effects and triggers wave cleanup
2. Verify `persistentEffects.size === 0` after cleanup
3. Verify `effectTimers.intervals === 0` after cleanup
4. Verify `effectTimers.timeouts === 0` after cleanup

### Debug Commands
```typescript
// Check current state
ResourceCleanupManager.logState();

// Force cleanup
ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupWaveResources(managers);

// Verify cleanup worked
const state = ResourceCleanupManager.getState();
console.assert(state.persistentEffects === 0, 'Effects not cleaned up!');
```

## Conclusion

**All persistent effects are properly managed:**

✅ All effects registered immediately after creation  
✅ All effects unregistered on natural expiration  
✅ All effects cleaned up during wave transitions  
✅ Cleanup order prevents callbacks on destroyed objects  
✅ Special cases (sludge slow, tesla particles) handled correctly  
✅ Memory leak safeguards in place  

No issues found. The persistent effect cleanup system is working as designed.
