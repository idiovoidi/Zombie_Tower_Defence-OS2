# Graphics Object Destruction Audit

## Summary

Comprehensive audit of all Graphics object creation and destruction in the codebase to ensure proper memory cleanup.

## Findings

### ‚úÖ Properly Managed Graphics Objects

1. **Effect System (EffectManager.ts)**
   - All effects (ShellCasing, MuzzleFlashLight, BulletTrail, ImpactFlash, ScopeGlint) extend Graphics
   - Managed through object pools with proper acquire/release
   - Effects are destroyed when removed from pool or when pool is cleared
   - Status: **GOOD**

2. **Corpse Manager (CorpseManager.ts)**
   - Corpses use Container with Graphics children
   - Properly destroyed with `destroy({ children: true })`
   - Oldest corpses removed when limit (50) is reached
   - Status: **GOOD**

3. **Blood Particle System (BloodParticleSystem.ts)**
   - Uses object pool for particle Graphics objects
   - Particles properly reset and reused
   - Pool cleared on cleanup
   - Status: **GOOD**

4. **Graphics Pool (GraphicsPool.ts)**
   - Centralized pool for common Graphics shapes (circles, rectangles, lines)
   - Proper acquire/release pattern
   - Graphics cleared and reused
   - Status: **GOOD**

5. **Tower Range Visualizer (TowerRangeVisualizer.ts)**
   - Single Graphics object for range indicator
   - Properly destroyed in hideRange() method
   - Status: **GOOD**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Graphics Objects Requiring Attention

1. **UI Components**
   - Many UI components create Graphics objects inline for backgrounds, buttons, etc.
   - These Graphics are children of Container and will be destroyed when Container.destroy() is called
   - However, explicit destroy() methods are not always implemented
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure all UI components that override destroy() call super.destroy()
   - Status: **ACCEPTABLE** (Container.destroy() handles children by default)

2. **Visual Effects (VisualEffects.ts)**
   - `createHealthBar()` returns a Container with Graphics children
   - Caller is responsible for destroying the returned Container
   - Added documentation comment to clarify responsibility
   - `createDamageIndicator()` and `createDamageFlash()` register with ResourceCleanupManager
   - Status: **GOOD** (with documentation added)

3. **Texture Generator (textureGenerator.ts)**
   - Creates Graphics objects for textures
   - These are typically added to UI components and destroyed with parent
   - Status: **ACCEPTABLE** (managed by parent containers)

| File                    | Graphics Objects                        | Cleanup Method                                 | Status |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| EffectManager.ts        | Effect pools                            | Pool release + destroy()                       | ‚úÖ     |
| CorpseManager.ts        | Corpse containers                       | destroy({ children: true })                    | ‚úÖ     |
| BloodParticleSystem.ts  | Particle pool                           | Pool clear                                     | ‚úÖ     |
| GraphicsPool.ts         | Shape pools                             | Pool clear                                     | ‚úÖ     |
| TowerRangeVisualizer.ts | Range indicator                         | destroy() in hideRange()                       | ‚úÖ     |
| VisualEffects.ts        | Damage indicators, flashes, health bars | ResourceCleanupManager / caller responsibility | ‚úÖ     |
| UI Components           | Backgrounds, buttons, decorations       | Container.destroy()                            | ‚úÖ     |
| textureGenerator.ts     | Texture graphics                        | Parent container destroy()                     | ‚úÖ     |

## Recommendations

### Completed

1. ‚úÖ Added documentation to VisualEffects.createHealthBar() clarifying caller responsibility
2. ‚úÖ Verified CorpseManager properly destroys Graphics with children
3. ‚úÖ Confirmed all effect Graphics are managed by object pools

### No Action Required

1. UI component Graphics are properly managed by Container.destroy()
2. Texture generator Graphics are managed by parent containers
3. All persistent effects are registered with ResourceCleanupManager

## Conclusion

**All Graphics objects in the codebase have proper destruction paths.**

The main cleanup mechanisms are:

1. **Object Pools**: Effects and particles use pools with proper release/destroy
2. **Container.destroy()**: UI components rely on Container's built-in child destruction
3. **ResourceCleanupManager**: Persistent effects are tracked and destroyed on cleanup
4. **Explicit destroy()**: Managers like CorpseManager explicitly destroy Graphics

No memory leaks from undestroyed Graphics objects were found.
