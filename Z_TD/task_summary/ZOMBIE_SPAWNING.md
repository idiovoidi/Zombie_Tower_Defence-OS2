# Zombie Spawning Implementation

## Overview

Zombies are now fully integrated into the game with proper spawning, rendering, and movement along the path.

## Key Changes

### 1. Zombie Positioning Fix (src/objects/Zombie.ts)

- Added `this.position.set(x, y)` in constructor to properly position the zombie Container
- Updated `moveTowardsWaypoint()` to move the Container position directly
- Zombies now move smoothly along waypoints using deltaTime for frame-independent movement

### 2. Delta Time Consistency (src/main.ts)

- Fixed delta time handling to use milliseconds consistently
- Game updates use milliseconds (for zombie movement, spawning, etc.)
- Resource generation and UI updates convert to seconds where needed

### 3. Zombie Rendering

Zombies are automatically rendered when spawned because:

- Each zombie extends `GameObject` which extends PixiJS `Container`
- Visual graphics are added as children in `initializeVisual()`
- The zombie Container is added to the game container in `ZombieManager.spawnZombie()`
- Different zombie types have distinct visual appearances:
  - **Basic**: Green circle
  - **Fast**: Yellow-green ellipse
  - **Tank**: Large dark green rounded rectangle
  - **Armored**: Gray-green with armor plating
  - **Swarm**: Small light green circle
  - **Stealth**: Semi-transparent dark gray
  - **Mechanical**: Metallic gray with gear teeth

### 4. Zombie Movement System

- Zombies spawn at the first waypoint from MapManager
- They follow the path defined by waypoints with smooth movement
- Speed varies by zombie type (25-100 pixels/second)
- Movement is frame-independent using deltaTime

### 5. Wave Management

- WaveManager defines zombie composition for each wave (1-50+)
- Zombies spawn with delays based on spawn intervals
- Spawn queue is shuffled for variety
- Difficulty scales with wave number and player performance

## How It Works

1. **Game Start**: When a level loads, `GameManager.startGameWithLevel()` calls `zombieManager.startWave()`

2. **Wave Setup**: `ZombieManager.startWave()` builds a spawn queue from `WaveManager.getCurrentWaveZombies()`

3. **Spawning**: Each frame, `ZombieManager.update()` checks the spawn queue and spawns zombies at their scheduled times

4. **Zombie Creation**: `ZombieFactory.createZombie()` creates the appropriate zombie type with:
   - Position set to spawn point
   - Waypoints assigned from MapManager
   - Visual representation based on type
   - Health scaled by wave number

5. **Movement**: Each zombie's `update()` method moves it toward the next waypoint

6. **Rendering**: Zombies are automatically rendered because they're PixiJS Containers added to the stage

## Testing

With `DevConfig.TESTING.AUTO_START_GAME = true`, the game will:

- Skip menus and start level1 automatically
- Spawn test towers (if enabled)
- Begin spawning zombies immediately

## Next Steps

To see zombies in action:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Zombies will spawn at the left side of the screen (spawn point)
3. They'll follow the curved path you created
4. Watch them move along the waypoints toward the end

## Configuration

Adjust zombie behavior in:

- `src/config/gameConfig.ts` - Zombie types and base stats
- `src/managers/WaveManager.ts` - Wave composition and scaling
- `src/config/devConfig.ts` - Testing options (auto-start, spawn rates, etc.)
