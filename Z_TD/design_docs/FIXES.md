# Tower Defense Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Towers Not Attacking Zombies
**Problem**: Towers were placed but never attacked zombies.

**Solution**: Created `TowerCombatManager` to handle tower combat logic:
- Finds targets within tower range
- Checks if tower can shoot based on fire rate
- Applies damage to zombies
- Shows shooting visual effects

**Files Changed**:
- Created `src/managers/TowerCombatManager.ts`
- Updated `src/managers/GameManager.ts` to integrate combat system
- Updated `src/managers/index.ts` to export new manager

### 2. Money Not Spent on Tower Placement
**Problem**: Players could place unlimited towers without spending money.

**Solution**: Added money check before tower placement in `src/main.ts`:
- Checks if player has enough money before placing tower
- Shows debug message if insufficient funds
- Only places tower if player can afford it

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `src/main.ts` tower placement logic

## How It Works Now

1. **Tower Placement**:
   - Player selects tower from shop
   - Ghost tower shows placement preview
   - Click to place (only if player has enough money)
   - Money is deducted via callback in GameManager

2. **Tower Combat**:
   - Each frame, TowerCombatManager updates all towers
   - Towers find closest zombie within range
   - If fire rate allows, tower shoots at target
   - Damage is applied to zombie
   - Visual effects show shooting animation

3. **Game Loop Integration**:
   - GameManager updates zombie spawning/movement
   - TowerCombatManager updates tower combat
   - Dead zombies are removed
   - Wave completion is detected

### 3. UI State Management Issues
**Problem**: UI states were using inconsistent string literals causing menu navigation issues.

**Solution**: Fixed state management in UIManager:
- Added WAVE_COMPLETE state handling to show game UI
- Ensured all setState calls use GameConfig.GAME_STATES constants
- Fixed state transitions between menus and gameplay

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `src/ui/UIManager.ts` to handle WAVE_COMPLETE state
- Updated `src/main.ts` to use proper state constants

### 4. Quick Start for Testing
**Problem**: Difficult to test gameplay without going through menus.

**Solution**: Added development configuration for quick start:
- Added `SKIP_MENU` and `AUTO_START_GAME` flags in DevConfig
- Added `SPAWN_TEST_TOWERS` flag to pre-spawn towers for testing
- Game automatically starts with test towers when enabled

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `src/config/devConfig.ts` with testing flags
- Updated `src/main.ts` to support quick start
- Updated `src/managers/GameManager.ts` to spawn test towers

### 5. Visible Path Rendering
**Problem**: No visible path on the ground for zombies to follow.

**Solution**: Enhanced map rendering with visible paths:
- Paths now render as brown dirt roads with borders
- Waypoint markers shown as red circles for debugging
- Map background renders as grass
- Proper z-ordering ensures map renders behind game objects

**Files Changed**:
- Updated `src/renderers/VisualMapRenderer.ts` with improved path rendering
- Added debug logging to track rendering and spawning

## Testing

### Quick Test (Recommended)
The game is configured for quick testing:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Game automatically starts with 3 pre-spawned towers
3. Towers will immediately start attacking zombies
4. You can place additional towers from the shop

### Full Test
To test the complete flow:
1. Set `SKIP_MENU: false` in `src/config/devConfig.ts`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Click "START GAME" in main menu
4. Select a level
5. Place towers from the shop (requires money)
6. Towers should automatically attack zombies in range
7. Zombies should take damage and die when health reaches 0

## Development Configuration

Edit `src/config/devConfig.ts` to customize testing:
- `SKIP_MENU: true` - Skip menus and start game immediately
- `AUTO_START_GAME: true` - Auto-start the game
- `SPAWN_TEST_TOWERS: true` - Pre-spawn 3 towers for testing
- `DEFAULT_LEVEL: 'level1'` - Which level to load on quick start
