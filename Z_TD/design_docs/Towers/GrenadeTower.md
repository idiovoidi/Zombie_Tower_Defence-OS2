## Gameplay

### Role

**Mid-Range Area Damage**
- Fills gap between Shotgun (short) and Sniper (long)
- Explosive AoE damage
- Burst damage pattern
- Predictive targeting required

### Strengths

‚úÖ **Good Range:** 180 range is solid mid-range  
‚úÖ **Area Damage:** Hits multiple zombies in explosion  
‚úÖ **Cost Effective:** $600 is affordable  
‚úÖ **Arc Trajectory:** Can shoot over obstacles (future)  

### Weaknesses

‚ùå **Slow Fire Rate:** 0.6 shots/sec is quite slow  
‚ùå **Lower Damage:** 100 vs Flame's 200  
‚ùå **Projectile Travel:** Grenades take time to reach target  
‚ùå **Predictive Aiming:** Need to lead moving targets  

### Best Against

- **Grouped Zombies:** Explosive AoE shines
- **Choke Points:** Where zombies bunch up
- **Mid-Range Threats:** 180 range sweet spot

### Weak Against

- **Fast Zombies:** Hard to predict movement
- **Spread Out Enemies:** AoE wasted
- **Close Range:** Slow fire rate struggles

## Implementation

### File Structure

```
src/objects/towers/GrenadeTower.ts  - Tower class
design_docs/Towers/GrenadeTower.md  - This documentation
```

### Code

```typescript
import { Tower } from '../Tower';
import { GameConfig } from '../../config/gameConfig';

export class GrenadeTower extends Tower {
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    super(GameConfig.TOWER_TYPES.GRENADE, x, y);
  }

  public shoot(): void {
    super.shoot();
    // Grenade specific shooting logic
  }
}
```

### Projectile Type

Returns `'grenade'` from `getProjectileType()`

**Projectile Requirements:**
- Arc trajectory (parabolic path)
- Explosion on impact
- Area damage radius
- Visual explosion effect

---

## Visual Effects

### Launch Flash

- Bright orange/yellow flash (5px ‚Üí 8px ‚Üí 12px)
- Smoke puff after launch
- Less intense than flame tower

### Idle Animation

- Subtle bob up and down
- Simulates loading/ready state
- Gentle, rhythmic movement

### Future Effects

- **Grenade Trail:** Smoke trail during flight
- **Explosion:** Large orange/yellow explosion
- **Shockwave:** Expanding ring effect
- **Debris:** Particles flying outward
- **Impact Crater:** Ground scorch mark

## Balance

### DPS Analysis (Level 1)

**Single Target:**
- Damage: 100
- Fire Rate: 0.6/sec
- DPS: 60

**Multi-Target (3 zombies):**
- Effective DPS: 180 (60 √ó 3)

### Cost Efficiency

- **Cost per DPS:** $10 per DPS (single target)
- **Cost per DPS:** $3.33 per DPS (3 targets)

**Comparison:**
- Machine Gun: $2.60 per DPS
- Flame: $5 per DPS
- Grenade: $10 per DPS (single) / $3.33 (multi)

### Upgrade Value

| Level | Damage | Fire Rate | DPS | Cost |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----|------|
| 1 | 100 | 0.6 | 60 | $600 |
| 2 | 150 | 0.66 | 99 | +$450 |
| 3 | 225 | 0.73 | 164 | +$675 |
| 4 | 338 | 0.80 | 270 | +$900 |
| 5 | 506 | 0.88 | 445 | +$1125 |

## Strategy Tips

### Placement

**Best Locations:**
- Choke points where zombies group
- Mid-range coverage areas
- Behind front-line towers
- Covering multiple paths

**Avoid:**
- Front line (too slow)
- Long range positions (wasted range)
- Isolated spots (needs support)

### Synergies

**Good With:**
- **Shotgun:** Slows zombies for easier hits
- **Machine Gun:** Finishes wounded zombies
- **Sniper:** Takes out high-HP targets

**Weak With:**
- **Flame:** Overlapping AoE is redundant
- **Tesla:** Both are burst damage

### Upgrade Priority

1. **Early Game:** Don't build (too expensive)
2. **Mid Game:** Build 1-2 at choke points
3. **Late Game:** Upgrade to level 3-4
4. **End Game:** Max out for massive AoE

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

**Arc Trajectory:**
- Parabolic projectile path
- Can shoot over obstacles
- Visual grenade trail

**Explosion System:**
- Radial damage calculation
- Visual explosion effect
- Shockwave animation
- Debris particles

**Upgrade Variations:**
- **Cluster Grenades:** Multiple explosions
- **Incendiary:** Fire DoT after explosion
- **Sticky:** Attach to zombies before exploding
- **EMP:** Bonus damage vs Mechanical

### Special Mechanics

**Knockback:**
- Explosion pushes zombies back
- Delays zombie progress
- Stacks with other knockback

**Stun:**
- Brief stun on explosion
- Interrupts zombie movement
- Synergizes with other towers

**Armor Shred:**
- Reduces zombie armor
- Makes them vulnerable
- Team support role
