# Future Tower Ideas - Brainstorming

## Overview

This document contains creative tower concepts for future implementation. All towers follow the **zombie apocalypse survivor theme** - makeshift weapons built from scavenged materials, improvised defenses, and desperate ingenuity. Each tower should offer unique gameplay mechanics and strategic choices that complement the existing tower roster.

---

## Current Tower Roster (For Reference)

1. **Machine Gun** - Rapid fire, balanced stats
2. **Sniper** - High damage, slow fire rate, long range
3. **Shotgun** - Short range cone, area denial
4. **Flame** - Sustained damage, area effect
5. **Tesla** - Chain lightning, excellent vs mechanical

## Special Mechanic Ideas

### Combo Towers

**Concept:** Towers that work together for bonus effects

Examples:

- Ice + Laser = Shatter (instant kill on frozen enemies)
- Fire + Wind = Firestorm (spreads fire faster)
- Lightning + Water = Electrocution (chain damage bonus)

### Upgrade Paths

**Concept:** Towers can specialize at max level

Examples:

- Machine Gun ‚Üí Minigun (faster) or Heavy MG (more damage)
- Sniper ‚Üí Anti-Material (armor pierce) or Rapid Fire (faster)
- Flame ‚Üí Inferno (more damage) or Napalm (area denial)

### Placement Bonuses

**Concept:** Towers get bonuses based on placement

Examples:

- High ground: +20% range
- Near water: Ice towers more effective
- Near power source: Tesla towers stronger
- Grouped towers: Morale bonus (+10% damage)

## Balance Considerations

### Cost Tiers

- **Budget ($500-700)**: Basic utility, early game
- **Standard ($800-1000)**: Main defense towers
- **Advanced ($1100-1500)**: Specialized roles
- **Premium ($1600-2500)**: Powerful but expensive
- **Ultimate ($2500+)**: Game-changing abilities

### Design Principles

1. **Every tower should have a clear role**
2. **No tower should be universally best**
3. **Encourage diverse tower compositions**
4. **Provide counters to every zombie type**
5. **Support both active and passive playstyles**
6. **Visual clarity - players should understand what towers do**
7. **Satisfying feedback - towers should feel impactful**
