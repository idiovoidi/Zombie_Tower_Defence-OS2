# Memory Leak Investigation and Fixes

## Overview

This guide documents all memory leak investigations, fixes, and testing procedures for the Z-TD game. The game experienced severe memory leaks consuming up to 20GB of RAM, which have been systematically identified and resolved.

---

## Critical Memory Leaks Found and Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL: Zombies Not Being Destroyed ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `src/managers/ZombieManager.ts`

**Problem:**

- `removeZombie()` method removed zombies from the container and array but **never called `zombie.destroy()`**
- `clear()` method had the same issue
- Every zombie that died or reached the end remained in memory with all its components, graphics, and event listeners

**Impact:**

- Hundreds/thousands of zombie objects accumulating in memory over multiple waves
- Each zombie contains: Graphics objects, Components, Event listeners, Renderer objects
- This was the **PRIMARY** cause of the 20GB memory leak

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// In removeZombie()
public removeZombie(index: number): Zombie {
  const zombie = this.zombies[index];
  this.container.removeChild(zombie);
  zombie.destroy(); // ✅ ADDED: Destroy zombie to free memory
  this.zombies.splice(index, 1);
  this.zombiesDirty = true;
  return zombie;
}

// In clear()
public clear(): void {
  for (const zombie of this.zombies) {
    this.container.removeChild(zombie);
    zombie.destroy(); // ✅ ADDED: Destroy zombie to free memory
  }
  this.zombies = [];
  // ... rest of cleanup
}
```

### 2. CRITICAL: Game State Not Cleared Between Games ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `src/managers/GameManager.ts` - `startGameWithLevel()` method

**Problem:**
The game was **NOT clearing previous game objects** when starting a new game or restarting after game over/victory. This caused:

- All zombies, towers, projectiles, corpses, and blood particles from previous games to remain in memory
- Each new game **stacked on top** of the previous one
- Memory usage grew exponentially with each restart

**Impact:**

- **SEVERE**: Memory could grow from 500MB to 20GB+ over multiple game sessions
- Every restart added another full game's worth of objects to memory
- Objects were never garbage collected because they remained in the scene graph

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
/**
 * Clear all game state to prevent memory leaks when starting a new game
 * CRITICAL: This must be called before starting a new game or restarting
 */
private clearGameState(): void {
  // Clear all zombies (destroys zombie objects, blood particles, corpses)
  this.zombieManager.clear();
  console.log('  ✓ Zombies cleared');

  // Clear all towers (destroys tower objects and their effects)
  this.towerPlacementManager.clear();
  console.log('  ✓ Towers cleared');

  // Clear all projectiles (destroys projectile objects and their effects)
  this.projectileManager.clear();
  console.log('  ✓ Projectiles cleared');

  // Clear tower combat manager state
  this.towerCombatManager.setTowers([]);
  this.towerCombatManager.setZombies([]);
  console.log('  ✓ Combat manager cleared');

  console.log('🧹 Game state cleanup complete');
}
```

**Modified methods to call cleanup:**

- `startGameWithLevel()` - Now calls `clearGameState()` at the start
- `gameOver()` - Now calls `clearGameState()` after game over
- `victory()` - Now calls `clearGameState()` after victory

---

### 3. CRITICAL: EffectManager Not Instantiated or Updated ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `src/managers/GameManager.ts`

**Problem:**
The `EffectManager` class existed but was **NEVER instantiated, updated, or cleaned up** in the GameManager:

- Shell casings, muzzle flashes, bullet trails, impact flashes, and scope glints were being spawned
- These effects were added to the game container but **never updated or removed**
- Effects accumulated indefinitely throughout waves and game sessions

**Impact:**

- **SEVERE**: Shell casings and effects accumulated throughout all waves
- After 10 waves, hundreds of shell casings remained in memory
- Each machine gun shot added 1 shell casing that never got cleaned up
- Visual effects consumed significant memory and GPU resources

**Fix Applied:**

1. Added import: `import { EffectManager } from '../effects/EffectManager';`
2. Added property: `private effectManager: EffectManager;`
3. Initialized in constructor:
   ```typescript
   this.effectManager = new EffectManager(this.gameContainer);
   console.log('EffectManager initialized');
   ```
4. Added to game loop update:
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL: Update effect manager (shell casings, muzzle flashes, etc.)
   this.effectManager.update(deltaTime);
   ```
5. Added to wave cleanup and full game state cleanup

---

### 4. setTimeout Memory Leak in Zombie Damage Flash ✅ FIXED

**Location:** `src/objects/Zombie.ts`

**Problem:**

- `takeDamage()` method created a `setTimeout` callback for damage flash effect
- If zombie was destroyed before the timeout fired, the callback would still execute
- Timeout held a reference to the zombie, preventing garbage collection
- No cleanup of pending timeouts when zombie was destroyed

**Impact:**

- Zombie objects couldn't be garbage collected if they had pending damage flash timeouts
- Accumulated over time as zombies took damage before dying

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// Added field to track timeout
private damageFlashTimeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;

// Modified takeDamage() to clear existing timeout
public takeDamage(damage: number, towerType?: string): number {
  // ... damage logic ...

  if (this.visual) {
    this.visual.tint = 0xff0000;

    // Clear any existing timeout to prevent memory leak
    if (this.damageFlashTimeout) {
      clearTimeout(this.damageFlashTimeout);
    }

    // Store timeout ID for cleanup
    this.damageFlashTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (this.visual) {
        this.visual.tint = 0xffffff;
      }
      this.damageFlashTimeout = null;
    }, 100);
  }
  // ... rest of method
}

// Added destroy() override to clean up timeout
public override destroy(): void {
  // Clear any pending damage flash timeout
  if (this.damageFlashTimeout) {
    clearTimeout(this.damageFlashTimeout);
    this.damageFlashTimeout = null;
  }

  // Destroy renderer if it exists
  if (this.renderer) {
    this.renderer.destroy();
    this.renderer = null;
  }

  // Call parent destroy
  super.destroy();
}
```

---

### 5. Untracked setTimeout Calls ✅ FIXED

**Files Modified:**

- `src/objects/Tower.ts` (2 setTimeout calls)
- `src/managers/TowerCombatManager.ts` (2 setTimeout calls)

**Problem:**
setTimeout calls were not tracked by EffectCleanupManager, so they could continue executing after objects were destroyed.

**Fix:**
Wrapped all setTimeout calls with `EffectCleanupManager.registerTimeout()`:

```typescript
// Before (memory leak)
setTimeout(() => {
  // cleanup code
}, 100);

// After (tracked and cleaned up)
EffectCleanupManager.registerTimeout(
  setTimeout(() => {
    // cleanup code
  }, 100)
);
```

**Locations fixed:**

1. Tower muzzle flash cleanup (100ms)
2. Tower damage flash cleanup (100ms)
3. Lightning arc cleanup (150ms)
4. Flame effect cleanup (120ms)

---

### 6. Persistent Effects Not Cleaned Up Between Waves ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**

- Fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, and Tesla particles persisted indefinitely
- Effects created during a wave remained in memory even after the wave ended
- Memory usage climbed drastically: 300MB → 800MB → 1.5GB → 5GB+

**Solution:**
Created ResourceCleanupManager to directly track Graphics objects (not just timers):

```typescript
// Register persistent effect
ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(firePool, {
  type: 'fire_pool',
  duration: 2000,
  onCleanup: () => {
    // Custom cleanup logic
  },
});

// Unregister when naturally expires
ResourceCleanupManager.unregisterPersistentEffect(firePool);
```

**Updated all persistent effects:**

- Grenade explosions
- Fire pools (flame tower)
- Sludge pools (sludge tower)
- Tesla electric particles

---

### 7. Tesla Lightning Persistence ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Tesla tower lightning arcs persisted between waves if the wave ended while they were active.

**Root Cause:**
Two critical bugs:

1. **Wrong cleanup order** - Objects destroyed before timers cleared
2. **No protection** - Trying to destroy already-destroyed objects

**Fix:**

1. **Fixed cleanup order:**

   ```typescript
   // NEW (FIXED) ORDER:
   EffectCleanupManager.clearAll(); // Clear timers FIRST
   cleanupPersistentEffects(); // Then destroy objects
   ```

2. **Added protection:**

   ```typescript
   for (const effect of this.persistentEffects) {
     // Skip if already destroyed
     if (effect.graphics.destroyed) {
       continue;
     }

     try {
       if (effect.graphics.parent) {
         effect.graphics.parent.removeChild(effect.graphics);
       }
       effect.graphics.destroy();
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error destroying persistent effect:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

## Memory Leak Testing Guide

### Quick Memory Test (Browser Console)

#### Monitor Memory Usage in Real-Time

```javascript
// Start memory monitoring
const memoryMonitor = setInterval(() => {
  if (performance.memory) {
    const used = (performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576).toFixed(2);
    const total = (performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize / 1048576).toFixed(2);
    const limit = (performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit / 1048576).toFixed(2);
    console.log(`📊 Memory: ${used}MB / ${total}MB (Limit: ${limit}MB)`);
  }
}, 5000);

// To stop monitoring:
// clearInterval(memoryMonitor);
```

#### Test Game Restart Memory Leak

```javascript
// Test multiple game restarts
let restartCount = 0;
const testRestart = () => {
  restartCount++;
  console.log(`\n🔄 Restart Test #${restartCount}`);
  console.log('Memory before:', (performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576).toFixed(2) + 'MB');
};

// Call this after each game restart
testRestart();
```

### Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler Test

#### Step-by-Step Memory Leak Detection

1. **Take Initial Snapshot**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to **Memory** tab
   - Select **Heap snapshot**
   - Click **Take snapshot** (Snapshot 1)

2. **Play First Game**
   - Start a new game
   - Play through 5-10 waves
   - Let the game end (game over or victory)
   - Return to main menu

3. **Take Second Snapshot**
   - In Memory tab, click **Take snapshot** (Snapshot 2)
   - Select Snapshot 2
   - Change view from "Summary" to **"Comparison"**
   - Compare with Snapshot 1

4. **Analyze Results**

**What to Look For:**

✅ **GOOD (No Leak):**

- Zombie objects: 0 or very few
- Graphics objects: Stable count
- Container objects: Stable count
- Total size delta: < 50MB

❌ **BAD (Memory Leak):**

- Zombie objects: Hundreds/thousands
- Graphics objects: Growing significantly
- Container objects: Growing significantly
- Total size delta: > 500MB

5. **Repeat Test**
   - Start another game
   - Play through 5-10 waves
   - End game
   - Take Snapshot 3
   - Compare with Snapshot 2

**Expected Result:**

- Memory delta between Snapshot 2 and 3 should be similar to Snapshot 1 and 2
- No continuous growth pattern

## Expected Memory Behavior

### Memory Usage Over Time (After Fix)

```
Game Start:     300MB
Wave 5:         350MB
Wave 10:        400MB
Game Over:      420MB
New Game:       350MB  ← Should drop back down
Wave 5:         400MB
Wave 10:        450MB
Game Over:      470MB
New Game:       350MB  ← Should drop back down again
```

### Memory Usage Pattern

**GOOD (No Leak):**

```
Game 1: 300 → 400 → 350 (after cleanup)
Game 2: 350 → 450 → 350 (after cleanup)
Game 3: 350 → 450 → 350 (after cleanup)
```

**BAD (Memory Leak):**

```
Game 1: 300 → 400 → 400 (no cleanup)
Game 2: 400 → 900 → 900 (no cleanup)
Game 3: 900 → 1800 → 1800 (no cleanup)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Memory Still Growing

1. **Check Console for Cleanup Logs**
   - Should see: "🧹 Cleaning up previous game state..."
   - Should see: "✓ Zombies cleared"
   - Should see: "✓ Towers cleared"
   - Should see: "✓ Projectiles cleared"

2. **Verify EffectCleanupManager**
   - Should see: "🧹 Cleaned up X orphaned intervals"
   - Should see: "🧹 Cleaned up X orphaned timeouts"

3. **Check for Errors**
   - Look for any errors in console during cleanup
   - Check if destroy() methods are being called

4. **Use Memory Profiler**
   - Take heap snapshots
   - Look for "Detached" objects
   - Search for specific object types (Zombie, Tower, Projectile)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Memory usage stabilizes after multiple restarts
✅ No continuous growth pattern
✅ FPS remains stable (55-60 FPS)
✅ No browser crashes
✅ Cleanup logs appear in console
✅ Heap snapshots show proper cleanup
