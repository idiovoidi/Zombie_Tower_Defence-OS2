# Graveyard & Graphics Overhaul Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive redesign of the graveyard area and overall visual style for Z-TD. The goal is to create a more atmospheric, detailed, and visually cohesive apocalyptic environment that enhances the horror/survival theme while maintaining performance.

---

## 1. Visual Style Direction

### Core Aesthetic: "Post-Apocalyptic Gothic Horror"

**Key Visual Pillars:**

- **Decay & Desolation:** Everything shows signs of abandonment and deterioration
- **Atmospheric Lighting:** Moody shadows, eerie glows, fog effects
- **Color Palette:** Desaturated earth tones with strategic color accents
- **Detail Density:** Rich environmental storytelling through small details

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**

- Ground: `0x3a4a2a` (dark olive), `0x4a5a3a` (dead grass), `0x6a5a4a` (dirt)
- Graveyard: `0x1a2a1a` (cursed earth), `0x2a3a2a` (dead grass)
- Stone: `0x5a5a5a` (weathered), `0x3a3a3a` (dark stone)
- Wood: `0x4a3a2a` (rotted), `0x5a4321` (weathered)
- Metal: `0x6a4513` (rust), `0x8b4513` (heavy rust)

**Accent Colors:**

- Blood/Decay: `0x8b0000` (dark red), `0x1a1a1a` (black stains)
- Bone: `0xf5f5dc` (beige), `0xe5e5cc` (aged)
- Glow Effects: `0xff0000` (zombie eyes), `0x00ff00` (toxic), `0x6600ff` (stealth)
- Fire/Light: `0xff6600` (flame), `0xffaa00` (warm light)

  - Towers
  - Projectiles
  - Particles
  - Animated effects

**Culling:**

- Frustum culling (off-screen objects)
- Distance-based LOD
- Particle count limits
- Effect priority system

### 8.2 Texture Caching

```typescript
class EnvironmentTextureCache {
  private cache: Map<string, RenderTexture>;

  // Cache expensive renders
  cacheGraveyard(): RenderTexture;
  cacheGroundTexture(): RenderTexture;
  cacheStructures(): RenderTexture;

  // Invalidate when needed
  invalidateCache(key: string): void;
}
```

### 8.3 Performance Budgets

**Target Performance:**

- 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- 30 FPS minimum on low-end

**Budgets:**

- Draw calls: < 100 per frame
- Particles: < 500 active
- Graphics objects: < 200 active
- Texture memory: < 100MB
