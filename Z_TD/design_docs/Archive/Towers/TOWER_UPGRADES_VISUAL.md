## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes

1. All tower visual methods now use `this.upgradeLevel` to scale elements
2. `applyUpgradeEffects()` now calls `updateVisual()` after upgrading
3. New `addUpgradeStars()` helper method draws gold stars
4. Visual elements scale proportionally with upgrade level

### Upgrade Persistence

- Towers maintain their upgrade level between waves
- Visual state is preserved when towers are selected/deselected
- Upgrade visuals update immediately when tower is upgraded

## Bug Fix: Flame Tower Despawning

The flame tower despawning issue was addressed by ensuring:

1. `updateVisual()` is called after upgrades to refresh the display
2. Tower visuals are properly cleared and redrawn
3. No accidental removal of tower containers between waves

## Files Modified

- `src/objects/Tower.ts` - Added visual upgrade indicators to all tower types

## Testing

Run the game and upgrade towers to see the visual changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Place any tower
2. Select it and upgrade
3. Watch the tower grow, change colors, and gain gold stars!
