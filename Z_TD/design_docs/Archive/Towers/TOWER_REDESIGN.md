**Completed:** 2024 (Estimated)

## Overview

Towers have been redesigned to show little men operating weapons from defensive structures instead of simple geometric shapes.

## Technical Implementation

### Structure

Each tower now has two visual components:

1. **Base (static):** The tower structure that doesn't rotate
2. **Barrel (rotates):** The little man with weapon that tracks targets

### Shooting Effects

- Muzzle flashes appear at weapon tips
- Little man recoils when firing
- Different flash effects per weapon type
- 100ms animation duration

### Visual Details

- Little men have heads (skin tone) and bodies (colored uniforms)
- Weapons are appropriately sized and positioned
- Tower bases have architectural details (windows, vents, sandbags, etc.)
- Color schemes match original tower types

## Files Modified

- `src/objects/Tower.ts` - Updated all tower visual methods

## Testing

Run the game to see the new tower designs:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Place different tower types to see each unique design with its little man operator!
