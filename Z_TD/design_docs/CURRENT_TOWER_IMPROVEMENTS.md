## Balance Adjustments

### Machine Gun

- **Current:** Balanced
- **Adjustment:** Slightly increase fire rate at base level
- **Reason:** Should feel more "rapid fire"

### Sniper

- **Current:** High damage, slow
- **Adjustment:** Reduce cost from $1200 to $1000
- **Reason:** Too expensive for single-target damage

### Shotgun

- **Current:** 0.8 shots/second
- **Adjustment:** Increase to 1.0 shots/second
- **Reason:** Feels too sluggish, needs faster rhythm

### Flame

- **Current:** Projectile-based
- **Adjustment:** Change to continuous beam
- **Reason:** More authentic flamethrower feel

### Tesla

- **Current:** Very strong vs Mechanical (2.0x)
- **Adjustment:** Reduce to 1.8x, but add chain priority
- **Reason:** Less hard counter, more strategic

## New Mechanics to Consider

### 1. **Tower Synergies**

Towers near each other get bonuses:

- Machine Gun + Sniper: "Covering Fire" - +10% damage both
- Shotgun + Flame: "Inferno" - Fire spreads faster
- Tesla + Any: "Conductor" - +15% damage to electrified targets

### 2. **Manual Abilities**

Each tower gets a manual-activated ability (cooldown):

- **Machine Gun:** "Suppressing Fire" - 3 seconds of 2x fire rate

- **Shotgun:** "Buckshot Blast" - 20 pellets in all directions
- **Flame:** "Inferno" - 5 seconds of maximum range/damage
- **Tesla:** "Chain Lightning" - Hits all zombies in range once

### 3. **Tower Morale**

Towers perform better when:

- Near other towers (not alone)
- Survivors are alive (high lives)
- Winning (zombies dying fast)

Towers perform worse when:

- Isolated
- Low lives (panic)
- Being overwhelmed

Visual: Survivor looks confident vs scared

### 4. **Ammo/Resource Management**

Optional hardcore mode:

- Towers need ammo/fuel
- Scavenger posts generate ammo
- Adds resource management layer
- Can be toggled on/off

### 5. **Tower Rotation**

Allow manual tower rotation:
