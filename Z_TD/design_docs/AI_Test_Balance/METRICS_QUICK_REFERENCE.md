## üí° Quick Optimization Tips

### If Damage/Dollar is Low:

1. Build fewer towers, upgrade more
2. Focus on cost-effective tower types
3. Place towers in high-traffic areas

### If Overkill is High:

1. Spread towers out more
2. Use different tower types
3. Avoid stacking too much damage in one spot

### If Economy is Declining:

1. Build fewer towers per wave
2. Wait for more money before upgrading
3. Focus on income-generating strategies

### If Accuracy is Low:

1. Use more area-effect towers (Shotgun, Tesla, Flame)
2. Place towers closer to path
3. Upgrade tower range
