## Analyzing Reports

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Survival Rate**: Are you losing too many lives?
2. **Economy Efficiency**: Are you earning more than spending?
3. **Damage Per Dollar**: Are your towers cost-effective?
4. **Cash Flow Trend**: Is your economy growing or declining?
5. **Average DPS**: Is your damage output sufficient?
6. **Overkill Damage**: Are you wasting damage?

### Red Flags

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bankruptcy Events > 0**: Running out of money
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Economy Efficiency < 100%**: Spending more than earning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Damage Per Dollar < 25**: Inefficient tower placement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Overkill > 10% of total damage**: Poor targeting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cash Flow Trend: DECLINING**: Unsustainable economy

### Optimization Tips

1. **High overkill?** ‚Üí Spread towers out, don't stack damage
2. **Low damage per dollar?** ‚Üí Focus on cost-effective towers
3. **Bankruptcy events?** ‚Üí Build fewer towers, upgrade more
4. **Low accuracy?** ‚Üí Use more area-effect towers
5. **Declining cash flow?** ‚Üí Balance spending with income
