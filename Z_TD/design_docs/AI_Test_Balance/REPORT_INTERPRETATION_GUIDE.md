## Report Structure

### 1. Basic Game Data

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T15:45:30.000Z",
  "sessionId": "session_balanced_example_001",
  "isAIRun": true,
  "duration": 420000,
  "gameData": {
    "highestWave": 18,
    "finalMoney": 850,
    "finalLives": 19,
    "survivalRate": 95.0
  }
}
```

**What to Look For:**
- **highestWave**: How far the player progressed
- **survivalRate**: Percentage of lives remaining (100% = perfect defense)
- **duration**: Total game time in milliseconds
- **isAIRun**: Whether this was AI or manual play

**Interpretation:**
- Wave 15+ = Strong performance
- Survival rate >90% = Excellent defense
- Survival rate <50% = Weak defense needing improvement

---

### 2. Balance Analysis Section

The `balanceAnalysis` object contains the core balance metrics and issue detection.

#### 2.1 Balance Issues

```json
"issues": [
  {
    "type": "WEAK_DEFENSE",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "message": "Survival rate is 0.0%, below threshold of 50%",
    "value": 0.0,
    "threshold": 50.0,
    "recommendation": "Build more towers and upgrade existing ones"
  }
]
```

**Issue Types:**
- `WEAK_DEFENSE` - Survival rate too low
- `INEFFICIENT_TOWERS` - Damage per dollar too low
- `EXCESSIVE_OVERKILL` - Too much wasted damage
- `NEGATIVE_ECONOMY` - Spending more than earning

**Severity Levels:**
- `CRITICAL` - Game-breaking issue, immediate attention required
- `HIGH` - Major problem affecting gameplay significantly
- `MEDIUM` - Noticeable issue that should be addressed
- `LOW` - Minor optimization opportunity

**How to Use:**
- Empty `issues` array = Well-balanced game
- Multiple CRITICAL issues = Major rebalancing needed
- Focus on HIGH and CRITICAL issues first

---

#### 2.2 Wave Defense Analysis

```json
"waveDefenseAnalysis": [
  {
    "wave": 10,
    "canDefend": true,
    "totalZombieHP": 8500,
    "totalTowerDPS": 285.3,
    "timeToReachEnd": 35.0,
    "damageDealt": 9985.5,
    "damageRequired": 8500,
    "safetyMargin": 17.5,
    "recommendation": "Defense is adequate with 17.5% safety margin"
  }
]
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **canDefend**: Boolean - can current DPS handle the wave?
- **safetyMargin**: Percentage of excess damage capacity
  - Positive = Can defend with margin
  - Negative = Insufficient DPS
- **damageDealt vs damageRequired**: Actual vs needed damage

**Interpretation:**
- Safety margin >20% = Comfortable defense
- Safety margin 10-20% = Adequate defense
- Safety margin 0-10% = Marginal defense
- Safety margin <0% = Will fail wave

**Action Items:**
- Negative margin = Build/upgrade towers immediately
- Low margin (<10%) = Prepare for next wave
- High margin (>30%) = May be over-investing in defense

---

#### 2.3 Tower Efficiencies

```json
"towerEfficiencies": {
  "SNIPER": {
    "type": "SNIPER",
    "cost": 200,
    "dps": 80,
    "range": 250,
    "accuracy": 0.95,
    "efficiencyScore": 95.0,
    "effectiveDPS": 78.4,
    "breakEvenTime": 22.5
  }
}
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **efficiencyScore**: DPS × Range × Accuracy / Cost
  - Higher = better value
  - Use to compare tower types
- **effectiveDPS**: Actual DPS after accounting for overkill
  - Lower than nominal DPS = wasting damage
- **breakEvenTime**: Seconds to recoup tower cost
  - <15s = Underpriced
  - 15-30s = Well-balanced

**How to Use:**
- Sort towers by efficiencyScore to find best value
- Compare effectiveDPS to nominal DPS to detect overkill
- Use breakEvenTime to balance tower costs

---

#### 2.4 Threat Scores

```json
"threatScores": {
  "BASIC": {
    "zombieType": "BASIC",
    "health": 100,
    "speed": 50,
    "count": 350,
    "reward": 10,
    "threatScore": 1.75,
    "threatPerDollar": 0.175,
    "isBalanced": false
  }
}
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **threatScore**: (Health × Speed × Count) / (Reward × 10)
  - 0.8-1.2 = Balanced
  - <0.8 = Too easy (underrewarded)
  - >1.2 = Too hard (overrewarded)
- **threatPerDollar**: Threat relative to reward
- **isBalanced**: Boolean flag for quick reference

**Interpretation:**
- Balanced zombies have threatScore near 1.0
- High threatScore = Zombie is too dangerous for its reward
- Low threatScore = Zombie is too weak for its reward

**Action Items:**
- threatScore >1.5 = Increase reward or reduce stats
- threatScore <0.5 = Decrease reward or increase stats

---

#### 2.5 Optimal vs Actual Tower Mix

```json
"optimalTowerMix": {
  "SNIPER": 8,
  "MACHINE_GUN": 6,
  "TESLA": 2
},
"actualTowerMix": {
  "MACHINE_GUN": 6,
  "SNIPER": 4,
  "SHOTGUN": 3
},
"mixDeviation": 18.5
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **optimalTowerMix**: Calculated best composition using marginal utility
- **actualTowerMix**: What was actually built
- **mixDeviation**: Percentage difference (lower = better)

**Interpretation:**
- Deviation <15% = Good strategy
- Deviation 15-30% = Suboptimal but acceptable
- Deviation >30% = Poor tower choices

**How to Use:**
- Compare optimal vs actual to identify strategy improvements
- High deviation suggests player/AI is not building efficiently
- Use optimal mix as a guide for future games

---

#### 2.6 Overall Balance Rating

```json
"overallBalanceRating": "GOOD"
```

**Ratings:**
- `EXCELLENT` - No issues, all metrics in optimal range
- `GOOD` - Minor issues only, well-balanced overall
- `FAIR` - Some notable issues, needs attention
- `POOR` - Multiple significant issues
- `CRITICAL` - Game-breaking balance problems

**Interpretation:**
- EXCELLENT/GOOD = Game is well-balanced
- FAIR = Review issues and make adjustments
- POOR/CRITICAL = Major rebalancing required

---

```json
"damageOutliers": {
  "mean": 3805.6,
  "standardDeviation": 1245.3,
  "outliers": [],
  "hasOutliers": false
}
```

**What It Means:**
- Detects unusual spikes or drops in metrics
- Outliers are values >2 standard deviations from mean
- Empty outliers array = Consistent performance

**How to Use:**
- Outliers indicate inconsistent balance
- Check waves with outliers for special circumstances
- Consistent performance = predictable difficulty curve

---

#### 3.2 Difficulty Trend

```json
"difficultyTrend": {
  "trend": "GETTING_HARDER",
  "slope": 0.18,
  "intercept": 1500,
  "rSquared": 0.96,

}
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **trend**: GETTING_HARDER, GETTING_EASIER, or STABLE
- **slope**: Rate of difficulty increase
  - >0.2 = Steep difficulty curve
  - 0.1-0.2 = Moderate increase
  - <0.1 = Gentle curve
- **rSquared**: How well data fits trend (0-1)
  - >0.85 = HIGH confidence
  - 0.65-0.85 = MEDIUM confidence
  - <0.65 = LOW confidence

**Interpretation:**
- GETTING_HARDER with high R² = Predictable scaling
- Steep slope (>0.2) = May be too difficult
- Low R² = Inconsistent difficulty (spikes/valleys)

---

#### 3.3 Wave Predictions

```json
"wavePredictions": [
  {
    "wave": 19,
    "predictedDifficulty": 16200,
    "recommendedDPS": 463.0,
    "confidenceInterval": {"lower": 15800, "upper": 16600}
  }
]
```

**How to Use:**
- **predictedDifficulty**: Expected zombie HP for future waves
- **recommendedDPS**: DPS needed to defend
- **confidenceInterval**: Range of possible values

**Action Items:**
- Use predictions to plan tower builds
- If recommendedDPS exceeds current DPS, upgrade towers
- Wide confidence intervals = less predictable difficulty

---

### 4. Dashboard Data

```json
"dashboardData": {
  "labels": ["Wave 1", "Wave 3", "Wave 5", ...],
  "datasets": {
    "playerDPS": [95.2, 158.4, 225.6, ...],

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: No Balance Data in Report

**Cause:** BalanceTrackingManager not enabled or integrated

**Fix:**
1. Check GameManager has BalanceTrackingManager instance
2. Verify tracking is enabled: `balanceTrackingManager.enable()`
3. Ensure tracking calls integrated in game systems

---

### Issue: All Metrics Show Zero

**Cause:** Tracking methods not being called

**Fix:**
1. Integrate `trackDamage()` in combat system
2. Integrate `trackEconomy()` in money system
3. Integrate `trackWaveStart/Complete()` in wave manager
4. Integrate `trackTowerPlaced/Upgraded()` in tower manager

---

### Issue: Predictions Seem Inaccurate

**Cause:** Insufficient historical data or inconsistent difficulty

**Fix:**
1. Need at least 5 waves for reliable predictions
2. Check `rSquared` value - low values indicate poor fit
3. Review difficulty scaling for consistency

---

### Issue: Threat Scores All Unbalanced

**Cause:** Reward values not properly tuned

**Fix:**
1. Adjust zombie rewards to match difficulty
2. Use formula: reward = (health × speed × avgCount) / 100
3. Iterate based on threat score feedback

---

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Technique 1: Cross-Session Comparison

Compare multiple reports to identify patterns:
1. Collect 5-10 reports from different sessions
2. Average key metrics across sessions
3. Look for consistent issues
4. Identify session-specific anomalies

### Technique 2: Difficulty Curve Visualization

Plot predicted difficulty over 30+ waves:
1. Use `wavePredictions` data
2. Graph predictedDifficulty vs wave number
3. Check for exponential growth
4. Identify difficulty spikes

### Technique 3: Tower Meta Analysis

Analyze which towers are most effective:
1. Compare `efficiencyScore` across all reports
2. Track which towers appear in `optimalTowerMix`
3. Identify underused towers
4. Balance tower stats accordingly

### Technique 4: Economy Flow Analysis

Track money over time:
1. Plot `moneyTimeline` data
2. Identify bankruptcy events
3. Check `netIncomePerWave` for negative values
4. Adjust rewards/costs to smooth economy
