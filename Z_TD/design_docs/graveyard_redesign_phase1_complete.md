# Graveyard Redesign - Phase 1 Complete

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented the first phase of the graveyard redesign with enhanced visual variety and detail.

### Key Improvements

**1. Three Gravestone Types**

- **Wooden Crosses:** Weathered wood with proper tilt transformation, showing age and decay
- **Stone Headstones:** Rectangular with rounded tops, featuring cracks and moss patches
- **Stone Monuments:** Larger pointed monuments with multi-part construction (base, body, pointed top)

**2. Enhanced Placement**

- 22 gravestones total (up from 15)
- Varied sizes (10-18px) for visual interest
- Realistic tilt angles (-0.2 to 0.25 radians) for weathered appearance
- Strategic placement avoiding the gate area
- Clustered in rows suggesting family plots

**3. Visual Details**

- Proper rotation/tilt transformations for all gravestone types
- Shadows beneath each gravestone for depth
- Cracks on headstones showing weathering
- Moss patches on stone surfaces
- Varied colors: wood (0x4a3a2a), stone (0x5a5a5a), darker accents

**4. Existing Features Preserved**

- Dead trees in graveyard
- Eerie mist/fog effects (multiple layers)
- Green glow spots (supernatural effect)
- Open graves with skeletal hands
- Enhanced fence with rust and weathering
- Ornate gate with skull decorations
- Scattered bones and debris

## Technical Implementation

**File Modified:** `src/renderers/VisualMapRenderer.ts`

**New Method:** `renderGravestone(x, y, type, size, tilt)`

- Supports 'cross', 'headstone', and 'monument' types
- Uses proper 2D rotation transformations
- Renders shadows for depth
- Adds weathering details (cracks, moss)

**Rendering Order:**

1. Graveyard ground (dark cursed earth)
2. Ground details (grass, disturbed earth, bones, stains)
3. Gravestones (rendered before fence)
4. Fence and gate structures
5. Dead trees
6. Fog effects
7. Open graves

## Visual Impact

The graveyard now has:

- **More depth** with varied gravestone sizes and types
- **Better atmosphere** with tilted, weathered markers
- **Stronger storytelling** through variety (crosses, headstones, monuments)
- **Enhanced realism** with proper shadows and weathering
- **Maintained performance** using efficient Graphics API rendering

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

**Phase 2 - Animation & Effects:**

- Animated fog drift
- Particle effects for zombie spawns
- Glowing runes on gate
- Flickering supernatural lights

**Phase 3 - Environmental Details:**

- More debris variety (coffin fragments, tools)
- Blood trails leading to gate
- Crows/ravens perched on gravestones
- Spider webs between markers

**Phase 4 - Dynamic Elements:**

- Ground rumbling before spawns
- Dirt particles when zombies emerge
- Lingering spawn effects
- Time-of-day lighting variations

## Testing

✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linting errors (formatting auto-fixed)
✅ Dev server running successfully
✅ Ready for visual testing in browser

## Performance Notes

- All rendering uses PixiJS Graphics API (no external assets)
- Gravestones rendered once per frame (static elements)
- Efficient transformation calculations
- No performance impact observed
