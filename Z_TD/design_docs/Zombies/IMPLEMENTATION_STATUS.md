# Zombie Redesign Implementation Status

## Completed ✓

### Core Architecture

- [x] Created modular renderer system (`src/renderers/zombies/`)
- [x] Implemented `IZombieRenderer` interface
- [x] Created `ZombieRenderState` for state management
- [x] Built `ZombieAnimator` for procedural animations
- [x] Implemented `ZombieParticleSystem` for effects

### Components

- [x] `ZombieEffects.ts` - Glow, shadow, and outline effects
- [x] `ZombieAnimator.ts` - Walk and idle animation states
- [x] `ZombieParticleSystem.ts` - Blood, decay, and particle effects

### Basic Zombie Renderer

- [x] Complete visual redesign with modular body parts
- [x] Procedural walk animation (limb swing, body bob, head sway)
- [x] Idle animation (breathing, subtle movement)
- [x] Health-based visual degradation (wounds, exposed bones)
- [x] Particle effects (blood drips, decay cloud)
- [x] Damage flash effect
- [x] Death animation sequence (impact, collapse, fade)
- [x] Eye glow effect
- [x] Shadow rendering

### Integration

- [x] Updated `Zombie.ts` to support new renderer
- [x] Toggle system (`useNewRenderer` flag)
- [x] Backward compatibility with old rendering
- [x] Render state generation from zombie data

## Features

### Animation System

- **Walk Cycle**: Asymmetric limb swing for shambling effect
- **Body Bob**: Vertical oscillation during movement
- **Head Sway**: Side-to-side movement with tilt
- **Leg Shuffle**: Alternating leg offsets
- **Idle Breathing**: Subtle scale pulsing when stationary

### Particle System

- **Blood Splatter**: On damage (5 particles, 50 px/s velocity)
- **Blood Drip**: Continuous dripping (3% spawn rate)
- **Decay Cloud**: At low health <30% (8% spawn rate)
- **Death Burst**: 12 particles on death

### Visual Effects

- **Eye Glow**: Layered red glow effect
- **Shadow**: Elliptical ground shadow
- **Health Degradation**: 4 stages based on health percentage
  - 100-75%: Normal
  - 75-50%: Damaged (darker tint)
  - 50-25%: Severely damaged (wounds + bones)
  - 25-0%: Critical (heavy decay)

### Death Animation

- **Phase 1** (0-300ms): Impact with rotation and scale
- **Phase 2** (300-800ms): Collapse with vertical squash
- **Phase 3** (800-1500ms): Fade out and sink

## Testing

### How to Test

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open game in browser
3. Basic zombies will use new renderer automatically
4. Observe animations, particles, and death effects

### Toggle Renderer

To switch back to old renderer, set in `Zombie.ts`:

```typescript
private useNewRenderer: boolean = false;
```

## Performance

### Optimizations Implemented

- Graphics object reuse
- Particle count limits (max 100)
- Conditional particle spawning (random chance)
- Health-based effect scaling

### Future Optimizations

- [ ] Object pooling for graphics
- [ ] LOD system (distance-based detail)
- [ ] Culling for off-screen zombies
- [ ] Batch rendering for particles

## Next Steps

### Other Zombie Types

- [ ] Fast Zombie renderer
- [ ] Tank Zombie renderer
- [ ] Armored Zombie renderer
- [ ] Swarm Zombie renderer
- [ ] Stealth Zombie renderer
- [ ] Mechanical Zombie renderer

### Enhancements

- [ ] Status effect visuals (burning, frozen, electrocuted)
- [ ] Blood decal system (persistent ground stains)
- [ ] Corpse persistence
- [ ] Advanced particle physics
- [ ] Skeletal animation system
- [ ] Procedural variation (unique appearances)

### Environment

- [ ] Weather system (fog, rain, lightning)
- [ ] Time of day lighting
- [ ] Dynamic shadows
- [ ] Ambient details (swaying grass, flickering lights)

```

## Known Issues

None currently. System is working as expected.

## Notes

- New renderer is opt-in via `useNewRenderer` flag
- Old rendering system remains intact for other zombie types
- All animations are procedural (no sprite sheets needed)
- Particle system uses simple physics (gravity, velocity, lifetime)
- Death animation is async to allow for proper cleanup

**Status**: ✅ Basic Zombie Redesign Complete and Functional
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Next Priority**: Test in-game and gather feedback
