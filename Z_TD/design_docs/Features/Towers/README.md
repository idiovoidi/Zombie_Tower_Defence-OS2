## Tower System Architecture

### Core Components

**Tower Base Class** (`src/objects/Tower.ts`)

- Health management
- Targeting system
- Upgrade system
- Visual rendering
- Combat integration

**Tower Factory** (`src/managers/TowerFactory.ts`)

- Tower creation
- Type registration
- Configuration management

**Tower Placement Manager** (`src/managers/TowerPlacementManager.ts`)

- Placement validation
- Grid management
- Tower lifecycle

**Tower Combat Manager** (`src/managers/TowerCombatManager.ts`)

- Targeting logic
- Damage calculation
- Special effects (Tesla, Flame, etc.)

---

## Tower Upgrade System

### Levels 1-5

Each tower has 5 upgrade levels:

**Level 1-2:** Makeshift/Scavenged

- Basic functionality
- Rusty, weathered appearance
- Low cost

**Level 3:** Reinforced/Improved

- Enhanced stats
- Cleaner construction
- Medium cost

**Level 4:** Professional/Military

- Strong stats
- Military-grade appearance
- High cost

**Level 5:** Elite/Custom

- Maximum stats
- Custom modifications
- Very high cost

### Upgrade Costs

Costs increase exponentially:

- Level 2: Base cost Ã— 1.5
- Level 3: Base cost Ã— 2.25
- Level 4: Base cost Ã— 3.375
- Level 5: Base cost Ã— 5.0625

### Stat Scaling

Most stats scale by 50% per level:

- Damage: +50% per level
- Range: +10% per level
- Fire Rate: +20% per level

---

## Tower Placement Rules

### Valid Placement

- Must be on grass tiles
- Cannot overlap with path
- Cannot overlap with other towers
- Must be within buildable area
- Requires sufficient resources

### Grid System

- 64Ã—64 pixel grid
- Towers occupy 1 grid cell
- Visual ghost preview during placement
- Red tint for invalid placement
- Green tint for valid placement

---

## Tower Targeting System

### Default Targeting

Towers target the first zombie in range by default.

### Proposed Targeting Modes

- **First:** Target first zombie in range
- **Last:** Target zombie closest to exit
- **Strongest:** Target highest HP zombie
- **Weakest:** Target lowest HP zombie
- **Fastest:** Target fastest zombie
- **Closest:** Target closest zombie
- **Mechanical:** Prioritize mechanical zombies (Tesla)

---

## Tower Special Mechanics

### Machine Gun

- Rapid fire with consistent damage
- Proposed: Ammo belt mechanic with reload

### Sniper

- High single-shot damage
- Long range precision
- Proposed: Headshot critical hits

### Shotgun

- Cone spread pattern (7 pellets)
- Short range area damage
- Proposed: Knockback effect

### Flame Tower

- Continuous fire damage
- Damage over time effect
- Proposed: Burning ground patches

### Tesla Tower

- Chain lightning to multiple targets
- Chains increase with level (1-5 targets)
- 1.8x damage vs Mechanical zombies
- Proposed: Smart chaining, overcharge mechanic

---

## Resource Costs

### Base Costs

- Machine Gun: $300
- Sniper: $1000
- Shotgun: $500
- Flame: $750
- Tesla: $1200

### Sell Value

Towers sell for 75% of total investment (base + upgrades)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization

- Dirty flags for zombie/tower arrays
- Efficient targeting algorithms
- Particle effect pooling
- Maximum effect limits

### Memory Management

- Proper cleanup on tower destruction
- Timer tracking for effects
- Graphics object disposal

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. Tower veterancy system (kill tracking)
2. Manual abilities with cooldowns
3. Tower synergy bonuses
4. Upgrade visual progression
5. Critical hit system
6. Enhanced particle effects
7. Survivor personalities
8. Environmental interaction

### Under Consideration

1. Ammo/resource management (optional mode)
2. Tower rotation control
3. Contextual placement bonuses
4. Achievement integration
5. Tower presets/loadouts
