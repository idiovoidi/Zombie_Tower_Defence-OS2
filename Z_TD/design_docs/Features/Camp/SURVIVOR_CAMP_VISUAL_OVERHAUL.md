# Survivor Camp Visual Overhaul

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive visual redesign of the Survivor Camp to match the atmospheric, detailed aesthetic established by the Graveyard Graphics Overhaul and Zombie Environment Redesign. The goal is to transform the camp from a functional endpoint into an immersive, story-rich defensive position that feels lived-in, desperate, and worth defending.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Themes

- **Last Stand**: This is humanity's final defensive position
- **Resourcefulness**: Built from scavenged materials and desperation
- **Community**: Multiple survivors working together to survive
- **Contrast**: Hope and life vs. the death and decay of the graveyard
- **Atmospheric Consistency**: Matches the post-apocalyptic gothic horror aesthetic

### Visual Pillars

1. **Layered Detail**: Multiple depth layers create visual richness
2. **Weathering & Wear**: Everything shows signs of use and survival
3. **Dynamic Elements**: Animated fog, flickering lights, moving survivors
4. **Environmental Storytelling**: Every element tells part of the survival story
5. **Defensive Purpose**: Clear fortification with strategic elements

## Technical Implementation

### Rendering Architecture

```typescript
// src/renderers/camp/SurvivorCampRenderer.ts

export class SurvivorCampRenderer {
  private graphics: Graphics;
  private animationTime: number = 0;
  private campHealth: number = 100;

  // Sub-renderers
  private structureRenderer: CampStructureRenderer;
  private survivorRenderer: CampSurvivorRenderer;
  private lightingRenderer: CampLightingRenderer;
  private effectsRenderer: CampEffectsRenderer;

  render(x: number, y: number): void {
    // Layer 1: Ground preparation
    this.renderGroundLayer(x, y);

    // Layer 2: Structures (back to front)
    this.structureRenderer.renderBackFence(x, y);
    this.structureRenderer.renderTents(x, y);
    this.structureRenderer.renderWatchtower(x, y);
    this.structureRenderer.renderFrontFence(x, y);

    // Layer 3: Objects & Details
    this.renderSupplies(x, y);
    this.renderCampfire(x, y);
    this.renderEquipment(x, y);

    // Layer 4: Characters
    this.survivorRenderer.renderAll(x, y, this.animationTime);

    // Layer 5: Lighting
    this.lightingRenderer.renderLights(x, y, this.animationTime);

    // Layer 6: Effects (fog, smoke, particles)
    this.effectsRenderer.renderFog(x, y, this.animationTime);
    this.effectsRenderer.renderSmoke(x, y, this.animationTime);
    this.effectsRenderer.renderParticles(x, y);
  }

  update(deltaTime: number): void {
    this.animationTime += deltaTime;
    this.survivorRenderer.update(deltaTime);
    this.effectsRenderer.update(deltaTime);
  }

  takeDamage(amount: number): void {
    this.campHealth -= amount;
    this.showDamageEffect();
    this.updateDamageState();
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**Static Caching**

```typescript
class CampTextureCache {
  // Cache non-animated elements
  private cachedStructures: RenderTexture;
  private cachedGround: RenderTexture;

  // Regenerate only when damaged
  invalidateOnDamage(): void;
}
```

**LOD System**

```typescript
enum CampDetailLevel {
  HIGH, // All details, all animations
  MEDIUM, // Reduced particles, simplified survivors
  LOW, // Static structures only
}
```

**Culling**

- Render only when camp is visible
- Reduce particle count when off-screen
- Pause animations when not visible

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Graveyard Contrast

**Visual Opposition**
| Graveyard | Survivor Camp |
|-----------|---------------|
| Dark, cursed earth | Cleared, compacted ground |
| Death and decay | Life and activity |

| Ominous silence | Bustling activity |
| Zombie emergence | Human resistance |

**Atmospheric Balance**

- Graveyard: Source of horror
- Path: Transition zone
- Camp: Beacon of hope

### 2. Zombie Interaction

**Attack Visuals**

- Zombies converge on camp
- Survivors take defensive positions
- Muzzle flashes from weapons
- Impact effects on fence
- Damage accumulation visible

**Victory/Defeat**

- Victory: Survivors celebrate, repair damage
- Defeat: Camp overrun, fires, chaos

### 3. Tower Placement

**Clear Zones**
