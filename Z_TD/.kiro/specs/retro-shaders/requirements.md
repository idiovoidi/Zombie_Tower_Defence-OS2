# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds retro-styled visual effects to Z-TD through custom PixiJS shaders, providing players with nostalgic visual options including pixelation and CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) effects. The shaders will be implemented as optional visual enhancements that can be toggled on/off, giving players control over their visual experience while maintaining the game's performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to apply a pixelation shader to the game, so that I can enjoy a retro 8-bit aesthetic while playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pixelation shader is enabled THEN the entire game view SHALL display with a pixelated effect
2. WHEN the pixel size is adjustable THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of pixel size from 1x to 8x
3. WHEN the shader is applied THEN the game performance SHALL remain above 30 FPS on standard hardware
4. WHEN the pixelation effect is active THEN UI elements SHALL remain readable and functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to apply a CRT shader to the game, so that I can experience the nostalgic feel of playing on an old cathode ray tube monitor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CRT shader is enabled THEN the game SHALL display with scanlines, curvature, and phosphor glow effects
2. WHEN CRT effects are active THEN the system SHALL simulate screen curvature with configurable intensity
3. WHEN scanlines are displayed THEN they SHALL be evenly spaced and have adjustable opacity
4. WHEN phosphor glow is enabled THEN bright areas SHALL have a subtle bloom effect
5. WHEN the CRT shader is active THEN the system SHALL include subtle screen flicker and noise effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to toggle shader effects on and off, so that I can switch between retro and modern visuals based on my preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing shader options THEN the system SHALL provide a settings menu with shader controls
2. WHEN toggling shaders THEN the change SHALL apply immediately without requiring a restart
3. WHEN no shader is selected THEN the game SHALL display with its original visual style
4. WHEN switching between shaders THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without visual artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize shader parameters, so that I can fine-tune the retro effects to my liking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adjusting pixelation settings THEN the system SHALL allow real-time pixel size modification
2. WHEN configuring CRT effects THEN the system SHALL provide sliders for curvature, scanline intensity, and glow strength
3. WHEN changing shader parameters THEN the effects SHALL update in real-time during gameplay
4. WHEN shader settings are modified THEN the system SHALL save preferences for future sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shaders organized in a dedicated folder structure, so that the codebase remains maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing shaders THEN they SHALL be located in `src/ui/shaders/` directory
2. WHEN creating shader files THEN each effect SHALL have separate vertex and fragment shader files
3. WHEN adding new shaders THEN the system SHALL support easy integration of additional effects
4. WHEN shaders are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle shader compilation errors gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shader effects to integrate seamlessly with the existing PixiJS rendering pipeline, so that they don't interfere with game functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shaders are applied THEN they SHALL work with the existing PixiJS Application and Container structure
2. WHEN rendering game objects THEN shaders SHALL not interfere with sprite animations or transformations
3. WHEN shaders are active THEN the game's existing visual effects SHALL continue to function normally
4. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN shader impact SHALL be measurable and optimized
