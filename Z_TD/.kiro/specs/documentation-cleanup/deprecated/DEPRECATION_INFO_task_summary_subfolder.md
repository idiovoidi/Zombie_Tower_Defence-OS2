# Deprecation Info: design_docs/task_summary/ (entire subfolder)

## Original Path

`design_docs/task_summary/` (entire directory)

## Flagged Date

2025-10-25

## Reason for Flagging

This entire subfolder is in the wrong location. The `task_summary/` directory should be at the root level, not inside `design_docs/`. All files in this subfolder should be moved to either:

- Root `task_summary/` directory (if still active)
- `design_docs/Archive/` (if completed implementations)
- Deprecated area (if outdated)

## Files in This Subfolder

1. `GRENADE_TOWER_ADDED.md` - Grenade tower implementation summary
2. `MACHINE_GUN_BALANCE_UPDATE.md` - Balance update summary
3. `MACHINE_GUN_EFFECTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Effects implementation summary
4. `SNIPER_EFFECTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Effects implementation summary

## Verification Needed

For each file:

### GRENADE_TOWER_ADDED.md

- Check if grenade tower is fully implemented with projectiles
- Verify if this duplicates Archive documentation
- Confirm if grenade tower is in the game

### MACHINE_GUN_BALANCE_UPDATE.md

- Check if balance values are still current
- Verify if superseded by newer balance documentation
- Confirm if information is in main tower docs

### MACHINE_GUN_EFFECTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

- Check if effects are still implemented as described
- Verify if this duplicates Archive documentation
- Confirm if muzzle flash, shell casings still work

### SNIPER_EFFECTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

- Check if effects are still implemented as described
- Verify if this duplicates Archive documentation
- Confirm if muzzle flash, bullet trails still work

## Potential Replacement

**For each file:**

- **If completed and accurate:** Move to `design_docs/Archive/Towers/[FILENAME].md`
- **If outdated:** Keep in deprecated area
- **If duplicated:** Delete after confirming information is elsewhere

**For the subfolder:**

- Delete the `design_docs/task_summary/` directory after moving all files

## Notes

- This subfolder structure is incorrect and should not exist
- All task summaries should be in root `task_summary/` or `design_docs/Archive/`
- The design document mentions this subfolder should be merged with root task_summary/
- These appear to be completion summaries that belong in Archive
