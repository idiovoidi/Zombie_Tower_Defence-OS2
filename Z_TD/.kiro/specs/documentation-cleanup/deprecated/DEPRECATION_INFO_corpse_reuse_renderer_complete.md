# Deprecation Info: corpse_reuse_renderer_complete.md

## Original Path
`design_docs/corpse_reuse_renderer_complete.md`

## Flagged Date
2025-10-25

## Reason for Flagging
This document has "complete" in the title, indicating it's a completion summary rather than active design documentation. It describes a completed implementation of the corpse rendering system and should be moved to the Archive as a historical record.

## Verification Needed
1. **Check current implementation:**
   - Verify if `src/managers/CorpseManager.ts` still uses renderer reuse approach
   - Check if the death pose system (3 poses) is still implemented
   - Confirm blood pool rendering still works as described

2. **Check for superseding documentation:**
   - Look for newer corpse system documentation in `design_docs/Features/Zombies/`
   - Check if Archive already has corpse documentation

3. **Verify renderer integration:**
   - Confirm all 7 zombie renderers still work with corpse system
   - Check if renderer list is still accurate (BasicZombieRenderer, FastZombieRenderer, etc.)

## Potential Replacement
- **If still accurate:** Move to `design_docs/Archive/Zombies/CORPSE_SYSTEM.md`
- **If superseded:** Delete after extracting any unique information
- **If partially accurate:** Update and move to `design_docs/Features/Zombies/CORPSE_SYSTEM.md`

## Notes
- This is high-quality documentation with detailed implementation notes
- Contains useful performance metrics and testing results
- May have historical value even if implementation has changed
- The "Future Enhancements" section might still be relevant for active development
