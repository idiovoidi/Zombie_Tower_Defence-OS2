# Deprecation Info: RESISTANCE_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Original Path
`design_docs/RESISTANCE_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Flagged Date
2025-10-25

## Reason for Flagging
This document has "IMPLEMENTATION" in the title and describes a completed feature ("Implementation Complete"). It should either be moved to the Archive or consolidated with active combat documentation.

## Verification Needed
1. **Check current implementation:**
   - Verify if `src/config/zombieResistances.ts` still exists and matches description
   - Check if `Zombie.getDamageModifier()` method is still implemented
   - Confirm damage modifiers are applied in Projectile, TowerCombatManager as described

2. **Check for superseding documentation:**
   - Look for newer resistance documentation in `design_docs/Features/Combat/`
   - Check if this information is duplicated in other combat docs
   - Verify if Archive already has resistance documentation

3. **Verify accuracy:**
   - Check if damage modifier values are still current
   - Confirm type definitions (ZombieType, TowerType) are still accurate
   - Verify helper functions still exist

## Potential Replacement
- **If still accurate:** Move to `design_docs/Archive/Core_Systems/RESISTANCE_SYSTEM.md`
- **If superseded:** Delete after extracting any unique information
- **If partially accurate:** Update and move to `design_docs/Features/Combat/RESISTANCE_SYSTEM.md`
- **If duplicated:** Consolidate with existing combat documentation

## Notes
- Contains detailed implementation guide with code examples
- Includes useful helper functions and type definitions
- "Future Enhancements" section (visual feedback, UI indicators) might still be relevant
- Well-structured with testing and troubleshooting sections
