# Deprecation Info: animated_fog_implementation.md

## Original Path

`design_docs/animated_fog_implementation.md`

## Flagged Date

2025-10-25

## Reason for Flagging

This document has "implementation" in the title and describes a completed feature ("Implementation Complete"). It should be moved to the Archive as a historical record of the fog system implementation.

## Verification Needed

1. **Check current implementation:**
   - Verify if `src/renderers/VisualMapRenderer.ts` still has fog particle system
   - Check if fog animation (drift, bob, pulse) is still implemented
   - Confirm fog is still rendered in the graveyard area

2. **Check for superseding documentation:**
   - Look for newer fog documentation in `design_docs/Features/Environment/`
   - Check if Archive already has fog documentation

3. **Verify integration:**
   - Confirm `GameManager.update()` still calls `visualMapRenderer.updateFog(deltaTime)`
   - Check if fog parameters (22 particles, colors, speeds) are still accurate

## Potential Replacement

- **If still accurate:** Move to `design_docs/Archive/Features/Environment/FOG_SYSTEM.md`
- **If superseded:** Delete after extracting any unique information
- **If partially accurate:** Update and move to `design_docs/Features/Environment/FOG_SYSTEM.md`

## Notes

- Contains detailed implementation notes and configuration parameters
- Includes performance metrics that may be useful for reference
- "Future Enhancements" section might still be relevant
- Well-documented with code examples
