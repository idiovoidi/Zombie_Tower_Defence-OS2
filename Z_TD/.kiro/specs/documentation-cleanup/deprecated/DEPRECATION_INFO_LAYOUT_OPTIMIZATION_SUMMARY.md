# Deprecation Info: LAYOUT_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md

## Original Location

`design_docs/Core_Systems/Performance/LAYOUT_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Flagged Date

2025-10-25

## Reason for Deprecation

**COMPLETED OPTIMIZATION** - This is an optimization summary that may be better suited for Archive

## Verification Status

⚠️ **NEEDS REVIEW** - Determine if optimization is complete and implementation matches documentation

## Recommended Action

**ARCHIVE** - Move to `design_docs/Archive/Core_Systems/Performance/` if optimization is complete

## Verification Steps Needed

1. ⏳ Confirm layout optimization is fully implemented
2. ⏳ Verify current layout matches optimized design
3. ⏳ Check if any active documents reference this optimization
4. ⏳ Determine if optimization is ongoing or complete

## References to Update

- Update any references to point to Archive location
- Add note in Performance README about archived optimizations

## Notes

- This is an optimization summary, not ongoing documentation
- May still be relevant if optimization is ongoing
- Should be preserved in Archive if complete
