# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses performance degradation in the Z-TD tower defense game as waves progress. The game experiences frame rate drops and increased memory usage during later waves, impacting gameplay experience. The goal is to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks while maintaining visual quality and gameplay mechanics.

## Glossary

- **Game System**: The Z-TD tower defense game built with PixiJS and TypeScript
- **Wave**: A timed sequence of zombie spawns that the player must defend against
- **Render Loop**: The game's update cycle that processes game logic and renders graphics at 60 FPS
- **Memory Leak**: Unreleased memory references that accumulate over time causing performance degradation
- **Spatial Partitioning**: A technique to optimize collision detection by dividing the game world into grid cells
- **Graphics Object**: A PixiJS visual element that must be explicitly destroyed to free memory
- **Persistent Effect**: Long-lived visual effects like fire pools, explosions, or lightning that remain on screen
- **Cleanup Manager**: A system responsible for tracking and destroying game resources
- **Frame Rate**: The number of frames rendered per second, target is 60 FPS
- **Performance Bottleneck**: A system component that limits overall game performance

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to maintain smooth frame rates throughout all waves, so that gameplay remains responsive and enjoyable even in later stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Game System reaches wave 10, THE Game System SHALL maintain a frame rate of at least 45 FPS
2. WHEN the Game System reaches wave 20, THE Game System SHALL maintain a frame rate of at least 40 FPS
3. WHEN the Render Loop processes more than 50 zombies simultaneously, THE Game System SHALL complete each update cycle within 16.67 milliseconds
4. WHEN a wave completes, THE Game System SHALL execute cleanup operations within 100 milliseconds
5. WHILE the Game System is running, THE Frame Rate SHALL NOT drop below 30 FPS for more than 2 consecutive seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game's memory usage to remain stable across waves, so that the game doesn't slow down or crash during extended play sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Game System completes 5 waves, THE Game System SHALL maintain memory usage below 400 MB
2. WHEN the Game System completes 10 waves, THE Game System SHALL maintain memory usage below 450 MB
3. WHEN the Game System completes 20 waves, THE Game System SHALL maintain memory usage below 500 MB
4. WHILE the Game System is running, THE memory growth rate SHALL NOT exceed 10 MB per wave after wave 5
5. WHEN a wave cleanup occurs, THE Cleanup Manager SHALL release at least 80% of wave-specific resources within 200 milliseconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify specific performance bottlenecks in the game loop, so that optimization efforts can be focused on the most impactful areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game System SHALL provide performance profiling data for each major system component
2. WHEN performance profiling is enabled, THE Game System SHALL log execution time for update methods exceeding 5 milliseconds
3. THE Game System SHALL track the count of active Graphics Objects, Persistent Effects, and timers
4. WHEN Graphics Objects exceed 100 active instances, THE Game System SHALL log a warning
5. WHEN Persistent Effects exceed 20 active instances, THE Game System SHALL log a warning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all visual effects and game objects to be properly cleaned up, so that memory leaks do not accumulate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Graphics Object is no longer needed, THE Cleanup Manager SHALL destroy the Graphics Object within one frame
2. WHEN a Persistent Effect expires, THE Cleanup Manager SHALL remove the Persistent Effect from tracking and destroy associated Graphics Objects
3. WHEN a wave completes, THE Cleanup Manager SHALL destroy all wave-specific Graphics Objects
4. WHEN a zombie dies, THE Game System SHALL destroy the zombie's Graphics Objects and event listeners within 100 milliseconds
5. WHEN a projectile hits a target or expires, THE Game System SHALL destroy the projectile's Graphics Objects immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize collision detection and target finding algorithms, so that combat calculations do not become a performance bottleneck with many entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN finding targets for towers, THE Game System SHALL use Spatial Partitioning to query only nearby zombies
2. WHEN the zombie count exceeds 30, THE target finding algorithm SHALL complete in less than 1 millisecond per tower
3. WHEN updating zombie positions in the spatial grid, THE Game System SHALL complete updates in less than 2 milliseconds per frame
4. THE Game System SHALL rebuild the spatial grid only when the zombie array changes
5. WHEN processing projectile collisions, THE Game System SHALL check only zombies within the projectile's movement path

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize redundant array operations and object allocations, so that garbage collection overhead is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the zombie array has not changed, THE Game System SHALL NOT rebuild combat manager references
2. WHEN the tower array has not changed, THE Game System SHALL NOT rebuild combat manager references
3. THE Game System SHALL use dirty flags to track array changes instead of comparing arrays each frame
4. WHEN creating temporary objects in the update loop, THE Game System SHALL reuse object pools where applicable
5. THE Game System SHALL avoid array allocations in performance-critical update methods

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize visual effect rendering, so that particle systems and graphics do not cause frame rate drops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering corpses, THE Game System SHALL limit active corpses to a maximum of 50 instances
2. WHEN the corpse limit is reached, THE Game System SHALL remove the oldest corpse before adding a new one
3. WHEN rendering blood particles, THE Game System SHALL limit active particles to a maximum of 200 instances
4. WHEN rendering persistent effects, THE Game System SHALL batch similar graphics operations where possible
5. WHEN a visual effect completes its animation, THE Game System SHALL destroy the effect's Graphics Objects within one frame

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual effects to remain impactful and satisfying, so that performance optimizations do not diminish the game's visual appeal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are applied, THE Game System SHALL maintain all existing visual effect types
2. WHEN a zombie dies, THE Game System SHALL display blood splatter and corpse effects
3. WHEN a tower fires, THE Game System SHALL display muzzle flash and projectile trail effects
4. WHEN an explosion occurs, THE Game System SHALL display explosion graphics and area effects
5. WHEN lightning arcs between targets, THE Game System SHALL display chain lightning visual effects
