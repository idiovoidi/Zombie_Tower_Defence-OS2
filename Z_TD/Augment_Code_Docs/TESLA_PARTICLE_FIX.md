# ‚ö° Tesla Particle Memory Leak - FIXED!

## üî¥ The Problem

You reported that **Tesla tower particles are still persisting between waves** even after implementing the ResourceCleanupManager.

### Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, I found **TWO critical bugs** in the cleanup system:

#### Bug #1: Wrong Cleanup Order

**The Issue:**
In `ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupWaveResources()` and `cleanupGameResources()`, we were destroying objects BEFORE clearing their animation timers:

```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN) ORDER:
1. cleanupPersistentEffects()  // Destroy Tesla particle containers
2. EffectCleanupManager.clearAll()  // Clear animation intervals

// PROBLEM: Intervals were still running and trying to access destroyed objects!
```

**What Happened:**
1. Tesla tower shoots ‚Üí Creates particle container ‚Üí Registers as persistent effect ‚Üí Starts fade interval
2. Wave ends ‚Üí `cleanupPersistentEffects()` destroys particle container
3. Fade interval is still running ‚Üí Tries to access destroyed particle container
4. Causes errors or undefined behavior

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// NEW (FIXED) ORDER:
1. EffectCleanupManager.clearAll()  // Clear animation intervals FIRST
2. cleanupPersistentEffects()  // Then safely destroy objects
```

Now the intervals are stopped BEFORE we destroy the objects they're animating.

#### Bug #2: No Protection Against Already-Destroyed Objects

**The Issue:**
Tesla particles are added as **children of zombies**. When a zombie dies and is destroyed, its children (particle containers) are also destroyed automatically by PixiJS. However, the particle containers were still registered as persistent effects.

When `cleanupPersistentEffects()` ran, it tried to destroy already-destroyed objects:

```typescript
// OLD CODE:
for (const effect of this.persistentEffects) {
  if (effect.graphics.parent) {
    effect.graphics.parent.removeChild(effect.graphics);
  }
  effect.graphics.destroy();  // ERROR: Already destroyed!
}
```

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// NEW CODE:
for (const effect of this.persistentEffects) {
  // Skip if already destroyed (e.g., parent zombie was destroyed)
  if (effect.graphics.destroyed) {
    continue;
  }

  // Safe to destroy
  try {
    if (effect.graphics.parent) {
      effect.graphics.parent.removeChild(effect.graphics);
    }
    effect.graphics.destroy();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error destroying persistent effect:', error);
  }
}
```

Now we check if the object is already destroyed before trying to destroy it again.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Fixed Cleanup Order in `ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupWaveResources()`**

**File:** `src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
public static cleanupWaveResources(managers: GameManagers): void {
  console.log('üßπ Cleaning up wave resources...');

  // Clear all persistent effects (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, tesla particles)
  this.cleanupPersistentEffects();

  // ... other cleanup ...

  // Clear all effect timers (intervals/timeouts)
  EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();
  console.log('  ‚úì Effect timers cleared');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
public static cleanupWaveResources(managers: GameManagers): void {
  console.log('üßπ Cleaning up wave resources...');

  // CRITICAL: Clear all effect timers FIRST before destroying objects
  // This prevents timers from trying to access destroyed objects
  EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();
  console.log('  ‚úì Effect timers cleared');

  // Now safe to destroy persistent effects (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, tesla particles)
  this.cleanupPersistentEffects();

  // ... other cleanup ...
}
```

#### 2. **Fixed Cleanup Order in `ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupGameResources()`**

Same fix applied to the full game cleanup method.

#### 3. **Added Protection Against Already-Destroyed Objects**

**File:** `src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts`

**Method:** `cleanupPersistentEffects()`

**Changes:**
- Added check for `effect.graphics.destroyed` before attempting cleanup
- Wrapped destroy calls in try-catch for safety
- Prevents errors when objects are already destroyed by their parent

## üîç Why This Fixes the Tesla Particle Issue

### The Tesla Particle Lifecycle

1. **Creation:**
   ```typescript
   // Tesla shoots zombie
   const particleContainer = new Graphics();
   zombie.addChild(particleContainer);  // Attached to zombie!
   
   ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(particleContainer, {
     type: 'tesla_particles',
     duration: isPrimary ? 250 : 180,
   });
   
   // Start fade animation
   const fadeInterval = setInterval(() => {
     // Fade out over time
     particleContainer.alpha = 1 - progress;
   }, 16);
   ```

2. **Natural Expiration (if zombie survives):**
   ```typescript
   // After 250ms, interval completes
   ResourceCleanupManager.unregisterPersistentEffect(particleContainer);
   particleContainer.destroy();
   ```

3. **Wave End Cleanup (OLD - BROKEN):**
   ```typescript
   // Wave ends
   cleanupPersistentEffects();  // Tries to destroy particleContainer
   EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();  // Clears fadeInterval AFTER destroy
   
   // PROBLEM: Interval might still run one more time and access destroyed object!
   ```

4. **Wave End Cleanup (NEW - FIXED):**
   ```typescript
   // Wave ends
   EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();  // Stops fadeInterval FIRST
   cleanupPersistentEffects();  // Then safely destroys particleContainer
   
   // SUCCESS: Interval is stopped before object is destroyed!
   ```

### Edge Case: Zombie Dies Before Wave Ends

1. **Zombie dies:**
   ```typescript
   zombie.destroy();  // PixiJS automatically destroys all children
   // particleContainer is now destroyed (but still registered as persistent effect)
   ```

2. **Wave ends:**
   ```typescript
   EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();  // Stops fadeInterval
   cleanupPersistentEffects();
   
   // Check if already destroyed
   if (effect.graphics.destroyed) {
     continue;  // Skip, already cleaned up
   }
   
   // SUCCESS: No error trying to destroy already-destroyed object!
   ```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- Tesla particles would persist between waves
- Console errors about accessing destroyed objects
- Memory would accumulate with orphaned particle containers
- Possible visual glitches with particles stuck on screen

### After Fix:
- Tesla particles are properly cleaned up between waves
- No console errors
- Memory stays stable
- Clean visual transition between waves

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Visual Test

**Steps:**
1. Build Tesla towers
2. Let them shoot zombies (you'll see cyan electric particles)
3. End the wave while particles are still visible
4. Start next wave

**Expected Result:**
- All Tesla particles should disappear immediately when wave ends
- No particles should carry over to the next wave
- No visual glitches or stuck particles

### 2. Memory Test

**Steps:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Performance tab
2. Enable Memory checkbox
3. Start recording
4. Play through 10 waves with Tesla towers
5. Stop recording

**Expected Result:**
- Memory should stay around 300-500MB
- Small spikes during waves (normal)
- Memory drops back down after each wave
- No continuous upward trend

### 3. Console Test

**Steps:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Play through a few waves
3. Watch for cleanup messages

**Expected Output:**
```
üßπ Cleaning up wave resources...
  ‚úì Effect timers cleared
üßπ Cleaned up 8 persistent effects: {
  tesla_particles: 5,
  fire_pool: 2,
  explosion: 1
}
  ‚úì Projectiles cleared
  ‚úì Visual effects cleared
  ‚úì Blood particles cleared
üßπ Wave cleanup complete
```

**Should NOT see:**
- Errors about accessing destroyed objects
- Warnings about memory leaks
- Errors in the console

### 4. Debugging Test

**In browser console, run:**
```javascript
// Check current state
ResourceCleanupManager.logState();

// Should show:
// üîç ResourceCleanupManager State: {
//   persistentEffects: 0-5 (during wave),
//   cleanupCallbacks: 0,
//   effectTimers: { intervals: 0-10, timeouts: 0-5, disposables: 0 }
// }

// After wave ends, should be:
// üîç ResourceCleanupManager State: {
//   persistentEffects: 0,
//   cleanupCallbacks: 0,
//   effectTimers: { intervals: 0, timeouts: 0, disposables: 0 }
// }
```

## üìÅ Files Modified

### 1. `src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts`

**Changes:**
- Fixed cleanup order in `cleanupWaveResources()` (line 196-230)
- Fixed cleanup order in `cleanupGameResources()` (line 236-288)
- Added `destroyed` check in `cleanupPersistentEffects()` (line 124-171)
- Added try-catch for safety in `cleanupPersistentEffects()`

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Line 199-201: Clear timers FIRST
EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();
console.log('  ‚úì Effect timers cleared');

// Line 204: Then destroy objects
this.cleanupPersistentEffects();

// Line 134-137: Check if already destroyed
if (effect.graphics.destroyed) {
  continue;
}

// Line 143-151: Wrap in try-catch
try {
  if (effect.graphics.parent) {
    effect.graphics.parent.removeChild(effect.graphics);
  }
  effect.graphics.destroy();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error destroying persistent effect:', error);
}
```

---

## üéØ Why This Was Hard to Catch

1. **Timing Issue:** The bug only manifested when:
   - Tesla towers were shooting
   - Wave ended while particles were animating
   - Specific frame timing caused race condition

2. **Silent Failure:** PixiJS might not throw errors when accessing destroyed objects, just causing undefined behavior

3. **Zombie Parent:** Particles being children of zombies added complexity - they could be destroyed in two ways:
   - Parent zombie destroyed
   - Direct cleanup call

4. **Order Dependency:** The cleanup order mattered, but wasn't obvious from the code

---

## üöÄ Additional Improvements

### Defensive Programming

The fix includes several defensive programming practices:

1. **Check before destroy:**
   ```typescript
   if (effect.graphics.destroyed) {
     continue;
   }
   ```

2. **Try-catch for safety:**
   ```typescript
   try {
     effect.graphics.destroy();
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Error destroying persistent effect:', error);
   }
   ```

3. **Clear order documented:**
   ```typescript
   // CRITICAL: Clear all effect timers FIRST before destroying objects
   // This prevents timers from trying to access destroyed objects
   ```

---

## üéâ Summary

The Tesla particle memory leak was caused by:
1. ‚ùå **Wrong cleanup order** - Destroying objects before stopping their animation timers
2. ‚ùå **No protection** - Trying to destroy already-destroyed objects

The fix:
1. ‚úÖ **Correct cleanup order** - Stop timers FIRST, then destroy objects
2. ‚úÖ **Defensive checks** - Check if already destroyed before attempting cleanup
3. ‚úÖ **Error handling** - Wrap destroy calls in try-catch

**Result:** Tesla particles are now properly cleaned up between waves, with no memory leaks or console errors! ‚ö°üéâ
