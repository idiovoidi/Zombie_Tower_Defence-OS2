# 🧹 Cleanup Architecture - Memory Management System

## Overview

This document describes the **centralized cleanup architecture** implemented to prevent memory leaks in the Zombie Tower Defense game. The system uses a dedicated cleanup module that separates memory management concerns from game logic.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Original Issues

1. **Persistent Effects Not Cleaned Up Between Waves**
   - Fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, and Tesla particles persisted indefinitely
   - Effects created during a wave remained in memory even after the wave ended
   - Memory usage climbed drastically: 300MB → 800MB → 1.5GB → 5GB+

2. **Cleanup Logic Scattered Across Codebase**
   - Cleanup code was duplicated in multiple files
   - GameManager had bloated cleanup methods
   - Hard to maintain and ensure consistency
   - No centralized tracking of persistent effects

3. **No Automatic Cleanup on Wave End**
   - Cleanup only happened on game restart
   - Effects accumulated throughout all waves
   - Browser would eventually crash after 10-20 waves

---

## ✅ Solution: Centralized Cleanup Architecture

### Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Cleanup logic is isolated in a dedicated module
   - GameManager focuses on game flow, not memory management
   - Reusable cleanup utilities for common patterns

2. **Automatic Tracking**
   - All persistent effects are automatically registered
   - Centralized registry tracks all active effects
   - Easy to see what's in memory at any time

3. **Consistent Cleanup**
   - Single source of truth for cleanup logic
   - Guaranteed cleanup between waves and on game restart
   - No more forgotten cleanup calls

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **ResourceCleanupManager** (`src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts`)

The central cleanup module that manages all game resources.

**Key Features:**
- Tracks persistent effects (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, Tesla particles)
- Provides reusable cleanup utilities
- Separates wave cleanup from full game cleanup
- Debugging tools to monitor memory usage

**Main Methods:**

```typescript
// Register a persistent effect for automatic cleanup
ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(graphics, {
  type: 'fire_pool',
  duration: 2000,
  onCleanup: () => {
    // Custom cleanup logic
  }
});

// Clean up resources between waves
ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupWaveResources(managers);

// Clean up all resources when starting new game
ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupGameResources(managers);

// Debugging
ResourceCleanupManager.logState();
```

#### 2. **EffectCleanupManager** (`src/utils/EffectCleanupManager.ts`)

Manages timers (setInterval/setTimeout) to prevent orphaned callbacks.

**Key Features:**
- Tracks all active intervals and timeouts
- Clears timers on cleanup
- Prevents callbacks from executing after objects are destroyed

**Usage:**

```typescript
// Register interval for tracking
const interval = EffectCleanupManager.registerInterval(
  setInterval(() => {
    // Animation logic
  }, 16)
);

// Clear all timers
EffectCleanupManager.clearAll();
```

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Persistent Effect Registration

All persistent effects (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, Tesla particles) are registered when created:

**Example: Fire Pool (Projectile.ts)**

```typescript
// Create fire pool graphics
const firePool = new Graphics();
// ... draw fire pool ...

// Register as persistent effect
ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(firePool, {
  type: 'fire_pool',
  duration: 2000,
});

// Add to scene
this.parent.addChild(firePool);

// Animate with tracked interval
const fadeInterval = EffectCleanupManager.registerInterval(
  setInterval(() => {
    // Fade animation
    if (progress >= 1) {
      // Unregister when naturally expires
      ResourceCleanupManager.unregisterPersistentEffect(firePool);
      firePool.destroy();
    }
  }, 50)
);
```

### Wave Cleanup

Called after each wave completes:

```typescript
private cleanupWaveObjects(): void {
  ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupWaveResources({
    zombieManager: this.zombieManager,
    projectileManager: this.projectileManager,
    effectManager: this.effectManager,
  });
}
```

**What Gets Cleaned:**
- ✅ All persistent effects (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, Tesla particles)
- ✅ All projectiles
- ✅ All visual effects (shell casings, muzzle flashes, bullet trails)
- ✅ All effect timers (intervals/timeouts)
- ✅ Blood particles
- ❌ Corpses (fade naturally for visual continuity)
- ❌ Towers (persist between waves)
- ❌ Zombies (should be dead by wave end)

### Full Game Cleanup

Called when starting a new game or restarting:

```typescript
private clearGameState(): void {
  ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupGameResources({
    zombieManager: this.zombieManager,
    towerPlacementManager: this.towerPlacementManager,
    projectileManager: this.projectileManager,
    effectManager: this.effectManager,
    towerCombatManager: this.towerCombatManager,
    waveManager: this.waveManager,
  });
}
```

**What Gets Cleaned:**
- ✅ Everything from wave cleanup
- ✅ All zombies
- ✅ All towers
- ✅ Combat manager state
- ✅ Wave manager state

## 🔍 Debugging & Monitoring

### Check Current State

```typescript
// Get current counts
const state = ResourceCleanupManager.getState();
console.log(state);
// {
//   persistentEffects: 5,
//   cleanupCallbacks: 2,
//   effectTimers: { intervals: 3, timeouts: 1, disposables: 0 }
// }

// Log state with warnings
ResourceCleanupManager.logState();
// 🔍 ResourceCleanupManager State: { ... }
// ⚠️ High number of persistent effects - possible memory leak!
```

### Memory Leak Detection

The system automatically warns if:
- More than 20 persistent effects are active
- More than 20 intervals/timeouts are active

## 📊 Expected Memory Behavior

### Before Cleanup Architecture

```
Wave 1:  300MB
Wave 5:  800MB
Wave 10: 1.5GB
Wave 15: 2.5GB
Wave 20: 5GB+ (browser crash)
```

### After Cleanup Architecture

```
Wave 1:  300MB
Wave 5:  350MB
Wave 10: 400MB
Wave 15: 450MB
Wave 20: 450MB (stable)
```

Memory returns to ~300MB after game restart.

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

### When Creating Persistent Effects

1. **Always register the effect:**
   ```typescript
   ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(graphics, {
     type: 'effect_type',
     duration: 1000,
   });
   ```

2. **Unregister when naturally expires:**
   ```typescript
   ResourceCleanupManager.unregisterPersistentEffect(graphics);
   ```

3. **Use tracked timers:**
   ```typescript
   EffectCleanupManager.registerInterval(setInterval(...));
   EffectCleanupManager.registerTimeout(setTimeout(...));
   ```

### When Adding New Managers

Add cleanup support to `GameManagers` interface in `ResourceCleanupManager.ts`:

```typescript
export interface GameManagers {
  newManager?: {
    clear: () => void;
  };
}
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

1. **Object Pooling**
   - Reuse Graphics objects instead of creating/destroying
   - Reduce garbage collection pressure

2. **Texture Atlas Cleanup**
   - Track and cleanup unused textures
   - Prevent texture memory leaks

3. **Event Listener Tracking**
   - Automatically track and cleanup event listeners
   - Prevent listener memory leaks

4. **Memory Profiling Integration**
   - Integrate with Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler
   - Automatic leak detection in development

## ✅ Testing

To verify the cleanup system is working:

1. **Play through 10-20 waves**
2. **Monitor console logs:**
   ```
   🧹 Cleaning up wave resources...
     ✓ Cleaned up 15 persistent effects: { fire_pool: 5, sludge_pool: 3, explosion: 7 }
     ✓ Projectiles cleared
     ✓ Visual effects cleared
     ✓ Effect timers cleared
     ✓ Blood particles cleared
   🧹 Wave cleanup complete
   ```
3. **Check memory in Chrome DevTools:**
   - Memory should stay around 300-500MB
   - No continuous growth across waves
4. **Restart game multiple times:**
   - Memory should return to baseline (~300MB)

---

## 🎉 Summary

The centralized cleanup architecture successfully prevents memory leaks by:

1. ✅ Tracking all persistent effects automatically
2. ✅ Cleaning up between waves (not just on restart)
3. ✅ Separating cleanup logic from game logic
4. ✅ Providing debugging tools to monitor memory
5. ✅ Ensuring consistent, reliable cleanup

Memory usage is now stable across waves, and the game can run indefinitely without crashes! 🚀
