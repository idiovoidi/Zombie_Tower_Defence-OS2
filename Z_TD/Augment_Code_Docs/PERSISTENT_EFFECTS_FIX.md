# 🎉 Persistent Effects Memory Leak - FIXED!

## 🔴 The Problem

You reported that **particles from grenades, tesla, and sludge persist indefinitely** if a wave ends while their effect is active. This was causing massive RAM usage even after the previous fixes.

### Root Cause

The previous cleanup system had a critical flaw:

1. **Persistent effects were tracked by timers only**
   - Fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, and Tesla particles used `setInterval` for animations
   - When `EffectCleanupManager.clearAll()` was called, it cleared the timers
   - BUT the Graphics objects themselves remained in the scene!

2. **No direct tracking of Graphics objects**
   - The old system used `EffectCleanupManager.registerDisposable()`
   - But disposables were only called when timers completed naturally
   - If a wave ended mid-animation, the Graphics stayed in memory forever

3. **Example of the problem:**
   ```
   Wave 1: Create 10 fire pools → Wave ends → Timers cleared BUT graphics remain
   Wave 2: Create 15 sludge pools → Wave ends → Timers cleared BUT graphics remain
   Wave 3: Create 20 explosions → Wave ends → Timers cleared BUT graphics remain
   Result: 45 Graphics objects still in memory, still rendering!
   ```

## ✅ The Solution: Centralized Cleanup Architecture

We've implemented a **dedicated cleanup module** that separates memory management from game logic.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **New ResourceCleanupManager Module**

Created `src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts` - a centralized system for tracking and cleaning up all game resources.

**Features:**

- ✅ Directly tracks Graphics objects (not just timers)
- ✅ Registers persistent effects when created
- ✅ Immediately destroys effects on wave end
- ✅ Separates wave cleanup from full game cleanup
- ✅ Provides debugging tools to monitor memory

#### 2. **Persistent Effect Registration**

All persistent effects now register themselves:

**Before (OLD - BROKEN):**

```typescript
// Create fire pool
const firePool = new Graphics();
this.parent.addChild(firePool);

// Register disposable (only called when timer completes)
EffectCleanupManager.registerDisposable({
  dispose: () => firePool.destroy(),
});

// If wave ends, timer is cleared but firePool stays in scene!
```

**After (NEW - FIXED):**

```typescript
// Create fire pool
const firePool = new Graphics();
this.parent.addChild(firePool);

// Register as persistent effect (tracked immediately)
ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect(firePool, {
  type: 'fire_pool',
  duration: 2000,
  onCleanup: () => {
    // Custom cleanup logic (e.g., remove slow from zombies)
  },
});

// When wave ends, ResourceCleanupManager immediately:
// 1. Calls onCleanup()
// 2. Removes firePool from parent
// 3. Destroys firePool
```

#### 3. **Updated All Persistent Effects**

Fixed in these files:

**`src/objects/Projectile.ts`:**

- ✅ Grenade explosions
- ✅ Fire pools (flame tower)
- ✅ Sludge pools (sludge tower)

**`src/managers/TowerCombatManager.ts`:**

- ✅ Tesla electric particles

**`src/managers/GameManager.ts`:**

- ✅ Simplified cleanup methods to use ResourceCleanupManager
- ✅ Wave cleanup now properly destroys all persistent effects
- ✅ Full game cleanup for restarts

## 📊 What Gets Cleaned Up

### Between Waves (cleanupWaveResources)

Called after each wave completes:

- ✅ **All persistent effects** (fire pools, sludge pools, explosions, Tesla particles)
- ✅ **All projectiles** (bullets, grenades, etc.)
- ✅ **All visual effects** (shell casings, muzzle flashes, bullet trails)
- ✅ **All effect timers** (intervals/timeouts)
- ✅ **Blood particles**
- ❌ Corpses (fade naturally for visual continuity)
- ❌ Towers (persist between waves)

### On Game Restart (cleanupGameResources)

Called when starting a new game:

- ✅ Everything from wave cleanup
- ✅ **All zombies**
- ✅ **All towers**
- ✅ **Combat manager state**
- ✅ **Wave manager state**

---

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Console Logs

You should now see detailed cleanup logs after each wave:

```
🧹 Cleaning up wave resources...
🧹 Cleaned up 15 persistent effects: {
  fire_pool: 5,
  sludge_pool: 3,
  explosion: 7
}
  ✓ Projectiles cleared
  ✓ Visual effects cleared
  ✓ Effect timers cleared
  ✓ Blood particles cleared
🧹 Wave cleanup complete
```

### 2. Memory Monitoring

**In Chrome DevTools:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Performance** tab
3. Click **Memory** checkbox
4. Start recording
5. Play through 5-10 waves
6. Stop recording

**Expected behavior:**

- Memory should stay around 300-500MB
- Small spikes during waves (normal)
- Memory drops back down after each wave
- No continuous upward trend

### 3. Visual Test

**Before the fix:**

- End a wave while fire pools/sludge pools are active
- Start next wave
- Old effects would still be visible on screen

**After the fix:**

- End a wave while fire pools/sludge pools are active
- Start next wave
- All old effects are immediately removed
- Clean slate for new wave

### 4. Debugging Tools

You can check the current state at any time:

```typescript
// In browser console
ResourceCleanupManager.logState();

// Output:
// 🔍 ResourceCleanupManager State: {
//   persistentEffects: 5,
//   cleanupCallbacks: 0,
//   effectTimers: { intervals: 3, timeouts: 1, disposables: 0 }
// }
```

If you see warnings like:

```
⚠️ High number of persistent effects - possible memory leak!
```

That means something isn't being cleaned up properly.

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`src/utils/ResourceCleanupManager.ts`** - Main cleanup module (NEW)
2. **`CLEANUP_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Detailed documentation (NEW)
3. **`PERSISTENT_EFFECTS_FIX.md`** - This file (NEW)

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/objects/Projectile.ts`**
   - Replaced `EffectCleanupManager.registerDisposable()` with `ResourceCleanupManager.registerPersistentEffect()`
   - Added `unregisterPersistentEffect()` calls when effects naturally expire
   - Fixed: explosions, fire pools, sludge pools

2. **`src/managers/TowerCombatManager.ts`**
   - Replaced disposable registration with persistent effect registration
   - Fixed: Tesla electric particles

3. **`src/managers/GameManager.ts`**
   - Simplified `clearGameState()` to use `ResourceCleanupManager.cleanupGameResources()`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Testing Checklist:

1. ✅ **Play through 10-20 waves**
   - Monitor console logs for cleanup messages
   - Check that persistent effects disappear between waves

2. ✅ **Monitor memory in Chrome DevTools**
   - Memory should stay stable around 300-500MB
   - No continuous growth across waves

3. ✅ **Test specific scenarios:**
   - End wave while fire pools are active
   - End wave while sludge pools are active
   - End wave while explosions are happening
   - End wave while Tesla is zapping zombies

4. ✅ **Restart game multiple times**
   - Memory should return to baseline (~300MB)
   - No accumulation across game sessions

### If Issues Persist:

If you still see memory growth:

1. **Check console logs** - Are cleanup messages appearing?
2. **Run `ResourceCleanupManager.logState()`** - Are there warnings?
3. **Use Chrome Memory Profiler** - What objects are accumulating?
4. **Report back** - Share console logs and memory snapshots

## 🎉 Summary

We've successfully refactored the cleanup system to use a **dedicated cleanup module** that:

1. ✅ **Directly tracks Graphics objects** (not just timers)
2. ✅ **Immediately destroys effects** when waves end
3. ✅ **Separates cleanup logic** from game logic
4. ✅ **Provides debugging tools** to monitor memory
5. ✅ **Ensures consistent cleanup** across the codebase

The persistent effects memory leak should now be **completely resolved**! 🚀

Your game should maintain stable memory usage even after dozens of waves and multiple restarts.
